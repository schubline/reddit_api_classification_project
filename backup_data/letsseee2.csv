"A group of men live and die for their Saturday morning golf game. One of them transfers to another city and they're lost without him.

A new woman joins their Club. When she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, ""I played on my college's golf team. I was pretty good. Mind if I join you next week?

""No one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot. Finally, one man says ... Okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m. He figures the early tee-time will discourage her.

The woman says this may be a problem, and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.

They roll their eyes, but say, ""Okay"".

She's there at 6:30 a.m. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round. She's fun and pleasant, and the guys are impressed. They congratulate her and invite her back the next week. She smiles and says, ""I'll be there at 6:30 or 6:45.""

The next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp. Only this time, she plays left-handed. The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand. They're totally amazed.

They can't figure her out. She's very pleasant and a gracious winner. They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.

The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys. This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.

The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part. However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.

This woman is a riddle no one can figure out. They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse, and finally, one of the men asks her, ""How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?""

The lady blushes and grins. ""When my Dad taught me to play golf, I learned I was ambidextrous,"" she replies. ""I like to switch back and forth.""

""When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him. If his Willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed.""

The guys think this is hysterical. Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, ""What if it's pointing straight up?""

She says, ""Then, I'm fifteen minutes late.""",60,1527820373.0,8nkubh,3464,15 minutes late..,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8nkubh/15_minutes_late/,2018-05-31 22:32:53

"Mandatory, not today but about 11-12 years ago, maybe longer. 

So.  I was heavily in my fucked up days, and I was doing the usual lounging around like a leaky old slug man.  I was watching TV with my hands down around my junk.  I can distinctly remember Avril Lavigne coming on my screen and almost as if a light switch was flicked, I was instantly erect.

I sat there contemplating what to do for a few minutes, when I decided to phone my local (and favorite) escort Alexandra.  Now I can't explain enough how much I loved meeting this lovely young woman as she was full of youthful exuberance and had a fantastic body.  I was a hairy chested, beer bellied slob, sitting in my underpants, and I still looked down on her as if she was below me for being an escort.  

Anyways.  I phoned her up and arranged the meetup for an hours time.  I decided I needed an hour to prep myself and take a shower.  

So, the time was drawing near and (don't judge me for this) I started constructing my blanket and towel fort, as it was tradition.  I stacked it up real high, and had my blanket roof in place.

I normally build the blanket fort in my old bedroom, but today I put it in the guest room, where I normally mess around with escorts.  

So... The door rang, so I came down to meet Alexandra as I normally do.  I usher her upstairs and into my guest room.  We do our business and lay there for a while.  

This is where I FU'd big time.  When I'm done with my escorts and they leave I normally run through my fort as a kind of ceremony.  No idea why, but I always have.  So as Alexandra is laying there on my dingy, dirty bed.  I stand up, stretch and prepare myself for my destruction of the fort.  

She kind of stared at me as if I had 3 heads, but then let out a wondrous giggle.  This got me super pumped.  I started flexing and revving my legs up to try and get her to chuckle.  I run full fucking speed into the blanket fort I had constructed and next thing I know... SMASH.  I had flew directly out my 2nd story window and into the hedges / yard below.  So there I was.  Laying in my neighbors / my hedge with a broken rib, several cuts and a severe case of disappointment.  I had that after sex aura / waft floating around me, while lying there in agony.  

Alexandra got dressed and came down and phoned the ambulance for me.  She only took in calls from me after that, so I stopped seeing her.  

TL:DR: Phoned an escort and ran through a blanket fortress near a window, falling into my nearby hedge and having to go to hospital.

"Hello, this is my first post here.

I work at a car rental so my job is to have customers sign the forms and give them the car they rented. 

We also have a clubmember discount (this is important later).  Everyone can be a clubmember and it basically means that we put your details in the system so we can fill out the forms more quickly and as an added bonus your own risk on the car is lowered. Normally if you have an accident or hit a pole or scratch the car you have to pay anywhere between 600 and 1250 depending on the car. Club members pay 150-350‚Ç¨. 

Keep in mind being a clubmember is 100% free no extra charges just some nice discounts and we can help you quicker.

Well, meet the bitchy lady. Because I was in the garage helping another customer she had to wait 5 minutes which was absolutely unacceptable of course. Me explaining her nicely that I was alone in the store at the moment and that the customer before here just need some extra explanation about the car.

BL: Just give me the car keys so I can go.

ME: Sure, just sign here for the invoice and since you are a clubmember we already have all your personal details.

BL: Okay, looks at the receipt. Why is my own risk lowered to 350?

ME: I calmly explain here this is because she is a clubmember and it's a free bonus. It doesn't cost anything and will only save her money.

BL: I don't want my own risk lowered just remove it.

ME: It won't give you any discount, we lower it for free for returning customers. 

BL: Listen up, you remove it from the receipt because I don't want it.

ME: Shrugging, okay if that is what you want. I'll just change it in the system real quick and voila your own risk is now 1250‚Ç¨ instead of 350 and you still pay the same rate.

BL: Happily signs the required forms and I give her the car keys and she goes on her way.


Fast forward 2 days later she returns the car and there is a huge dent + scratch on the front side of the car.

So I explain her that she will have to pay for that and that it will.... ( Yeah, you guessed it) 1250‚Ç¨! The bitching lady completely loses it and tells me she is a clubmember and that she has reduced risk. I calmly explain to her that she didn't want the lowered risk. 

She asks for the manager and starts bitching against him. The manager completely takes my side because he already knew the full story. And the bitching lady had to pay up the full 1250‚Ç¨.

TLDR: Customer at a car rental didn't want free lowering of her own risk in case of accidents and scratches. She had to pay 1250 euro instead of 350 cause she fcked up the car.

Edit1: thanks Reddit this post is now 50% of my karma!

"There have been many controversies surrounding inappropriate handling of sexual violence in organizations, especially college campuses. A person is raped, they go to the college's ""appropriate"" administrator for sexual violence, the the story gets covered up, ignored, or otherwise handled incorrectly, and then there's a big controversy in the news about how college X is mishandling sexual assault cases.

My view is that the survivors of rape in these organizations should stop going through the middle men in the first place and just go to the police. When I read these news articles they often mention that it's well known among rape survivors that the college covers stuff up‚Äî[example](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/27/universities-actively-covering-up-sexual-assault-and-harassment-report-says). It seems to me that these survivors are putting their justice process through well-known risk and then acting surprised when it gets stifled.

Can someone explain to me why it's reasonable to go through all the red taping, the drama, and acting surprised when a rape is covered up for the umpteenth time instead of merely going straight to the police? If people keep doing it there must be a reason; I just don't know it.

Around 10am, she wakes up and rolls on the living room floor for a few seconds. Then, she jumps up on the couch and naps.

Around 1pm, she looks outside. I think there's metro mobility bus that comes by at this time. Back to the couch to sleep.

Around 3-4pm, she's awake and playing and looking outside a lot. I assume this is when a lot of neighborhood kids come home from school.

"I had a coworker about 6 years ago who was quite the bitter pill to swallow. She was about 45, and the special variety of holier-than-thou, my-shit-doesn't-stink christian we all know and hate, Ill call her Chastity, the one thing she lacked(I'm promiscuous, but she may as well have had a revolving door for all the men she saw). 

We had worked together for 2 years prior to this, but our animosity truly began when she first came to my church. I'm not the most pious man, but I try to do my best as a person and I think in gods eyes, thats good enough(I could get preachy here but I'll spare y'all the excess). And the fellow members of my congregation shared that same belief.

Chastity seemed to have an issue with the fact that I, a heavily tattooed, gay, not-well-dressed, gossip fiend, former addict(9 years clean), DARED to enter a church. I mean, how dare I not run away hissing and screeching from the house of god am I right? 

And so Chastity began to try and undermine me to this second family of mine. Now this was a bad idea on her part because I had been with this church since almost day one. When its first services were 20-30 people up til now, three services of 4-500. Many people knew me well, the first to volunteer and welcome new members, happy to take the lead for the childrens services on occaision, overall I'm well liked. 

But Chastity decided she would just tell everyone and their mother how much of a sinner I was. Talking about things I had supposedly said or done in the office. Naturally, this got back to me, a proper slut for gossip, VERY quickly. At first, I ignored it, then I got irritated, around Christmas I was fuming. Now whataya know? Chastity dragged her current piece of meat, her two daughters and her son with her to the christmas service. 

Suddenly something clicked, office gossip played in my head about Chastitys son. You see shortly after I began working with her she called out for about a week solid with ""inconsolable grief"" and she wouldn't explain why. Then the gossip began, and it was revealed to me that her son had come out of the closet and she was heavily in denial about it. This all came back to me in seconds, and the gears for sweet revenge began to turn in my head.

I waited like a patient tiger for my prey to approach, watching him near I realized he was actually pretty cute. About 21(I later found out he had just turned 21)nice little butt and a pouty RBF, and honestly, the most gorgeous eyes I've ever seen. Now at the time I was 36 and I had years of experience tripping up inexperienced men. We have a large coffee bar in the foyer that I was waiting at. The music had begun(we have a full band) and most everone was out of the foyer when the bar cleared enough for him to approach. 

I started soft, just some gentle flirting, prodding to see if he was even interested. As soon as I got a response I went in for the kill. Pulling him close and pushing the napkin with my number on it into his shirt pocket. His eyes go a little wide and I release him before anyone can take note of what happened. That afternoon I wasn't surprised to get a text. I can't remember it exactly, but heres how the conversation went.

Cutie-pie: You never told me your name.

Me: Oh my bad, hope thats not a problem.

Cutie-pie: Nope. Think you can tell or do I have to find out? ;)

Me: Well if you really want to know you'll have to ask me later, I gotta go. But I'll be at [bar] tonight if you don't want to wait.

And I had him. That first date went really well and as it turns out I was the first person he ever got drunk with. Now I had intended to just have a one night stand with him, just to rub it in Chastitys face, but I fell for him pretty hard, pretty fast. Next thing I know, a little less two months pass and I had totally forgotten my irritation with Chastity. 

Until she does it again, irritating me again. So the next day at work I take my lunch a little early to catch one of Chastitys ""friends"" who works in the same department as her. We talk and I say how glad I am to have gotten Valentine's day off, how much fun I was gonna have with Cutie-pie. I pretend not to notice her eyes bug out for a second. And so, lunch over, I head back and get back to work. In the middle of typing up a report I hear Chastitys heels click-clicking up to my office door. Living in a one party consent state, I set my phone to the side to record her. And boy does she have a lot to say. 

Chastity: What the fuck is wrong with you!?

Me: Pardon?

Chastity: Don't you give me that shit. Are you fucking my son!?

Me: I don't think thats any of your business.

Chastity:  It is my business! My son is not a fucking homo like you, what did you do!? Blackmail him!? Bribe him!? I'm gonna call the cops!!

Me: What I do on my free time with another adult has nothing to do with you, now if you would, leave me the hell alone.

Chastity: You stay the fuck away from my son or there will be hell to pay, you hear me!!?? 

And she stormed out. Five minutes later I'm in HR reporting her with the recording as evidence. An hour after that I leave early and take this to the police and get the info on how to file a restraining order on Chastity. Two hours later I'm home and fucking her son.

The next day was my day off, and the day after thay I was all too happy to hear she has been fired for gross misconduct and discrimination

My husband(yes the very same CutiePie) and I are celebrating our first anniversary next week.


TL;DR- Co-worker tried to bad mouth me to my fellow church members, I got with her son and got her fired.

P.S. I'll be deleting this account soon, but I'll try to answer as many questions as possible before I do.

"i never expected to have so much support. i posted that thinking i would get a few answers, but mostly shunned because i am a mormon.

it was quite the opposite. everyone here was so supportive and offered so many different views and opinions, opened my eyes to things i had never been exposed to. you guys are amazing. 

i had been under the impression from r/latterdaysaints that you guys were ‚Äúheathens‚Äù who would only be rude to me, but i experiences nothing of the sort. you all were more supportive than a lot of the people in the latter day saints sub. 

as for my faith standings, i don‚Äôt know if i can continue being a faithful mormon. while i was being shown stuff about this church finance thing, i was also shown a lot of other things, as well as the CES Letter. i met with my bishop today and asked him a small question about a few things i read in the first few pages of the CES Letter. 

he couldn‚Äôt respond well, and he suggested that i go and pray and ask god for revelation. 

i may still try and do that, as i have not entirely figured out if i‚Äôm going to stay in church and all of what i believe, but you guys might see a little more of me as i journey through this faith crisis.

i was first urged to post here by my cousin, who is also on r/exmormon. i never would have gotten the courage to do t without her. thank youüíó

and thank you all again for your overwhelming support. i feel more at home here, even as a mormon, than i ever have in r/latterdaysaints, and that‚Äôs saying something as a mormon for 8 years.

"On mobile, sorry for format...

This happened a few years ago when I was working for a little pizza shop in my town, I was working the counter so answering phones and taking orders. This was my favorite call I‚Äôve ever gotten. I will be Me, Customer will be C.

Me: hi pizza shop, pick up or delivery?

C: Uhm hi? I got a delivery an hour ago and you guys delivered me half a pizza, YUP ONLY HALF. I can‚Äôt believe this even happened. Are you kidding me? I need a whole new pizza!

Me: I‚Äôm sorry sir I‚Äôm not quite understanding. There‚Äôs no way we delivered you a half a pizza. 

C: well it happened!! I can‚Äôt believe this, absolutely ridiculous !!!! You better believe I am NEVER ordering from this place EVER AGAIN!

Me: okay I‚Äôm very sorry sir. Are you sure it was only half a pizza? I can check with the pizza guy but I just don‚Äôt know how that could have happened.

C: I will be in later to pick up a gift card for my refund!

Customer hangs up, we talk about how weird that was and how impossible it would have been. It was so bizarre.

An hour later...

Me: Hi pizza shop, pick up or delivery?

C: hi, I called earlier about getting half a pizza...I just wanted to call and apologize because my kids actually ate the pizza and I didn‚Äôt realize they did. I‚Äôm sorry and I won‚Äôt need a gift card. 

HOW DO YOU NOT ASK YOUR FAMILY IF THEY ATE THE PIZZA??? This guy jumped to assuming we sent him a half eaten pizza!!! Sadly not my craziest customer.

"I started at 245 and reached 225 yesterday after about 2 months. My progress has felt slow \(compared to some people\) but it's also been very steady so I'm quite proud to be down 20 lbs. So far all I've done is small diet changes \(a little bit of CICO, a little bit of Keto\), getting more steps in everyday, and the holy grail of my weight loss: intermittent fasting.

Now I'm ready \(and honestly excited to\) to push myself more. My jog yesterday felt so amazing knowing that it's only going to get easier, that I'm going to keep losing weight and getting stronger, and it hasn't been as hard as I always feared it would be. 

If anybody reading this is just starting their weight loss journey, the most significant thing for me was getting in a mind set of **Just Do It**. We are creatures of habit. If you like to sit around your house playing video games while eating hot cheetos, that habit is going to be hard to break. In the beginning you might just have to force yourself, but you'll develop new habits quickly. Just remember to not be too hard on yourself and don't give up if you think you're failing.

"So today in Spanish class, my teacher told us that we would be listening to a song in Spanish. Already, I began to tremble. I had a bad feeling about this. ‚ÄúWhich one?‚Äù I ask shakily, not wanting to hear the answer. ‚ÄúDespacito‚Äù She responds. I begin to hyperventilate. My worst fears have been realized. I fade in and out of conciseness. I clamp my palms over my ears, but I know it‚Äôs futile. The song plays. I‚Äôm crying now, praying. God, Allah, Buddha please help me. I curl up on the floor. There‚Äôs nothing I can do now. And then it happens. The chorus plays. The girls in my class open their mouths. The screams of the damned, the shrieks of the tortured fill my ears and bounce around my skull. My eardrums rupture, blood leaking out. I try to scream, but no sound comes out. I can only sit there, violently shaking as it happens to me. After what seems like hours, it‚Äôs finally over. I try to move, but I cannot make myself. My brain shuts down as my vision fades to black. I muster the last of my energy, uttering the accursed word.

"I was Baker Acted two months ago and received a bill for the 72 hold (for part of which, I was released to my parents' custody for the rest of the 72 hour hold)

A little backstory, I was told by the police officers who took me to the hospital that they were doing a two hour evaluation and would determine if I needed to be held.

I was never evaluated, nor was I seen by a psychologist until the next day and only for five minutes. 

My first encounter with a professional there was the hospital finance lady. She handed me a page and asked me to sign. The page had ""5/9"" at the bottom with no other pages, so I asked for the rest.

She left and, after some time, gave me the rest of the pages. I read them and did not want to sign because they had a clause about me being financially responsible for all fees incurred. I let the lady know and she told me they would not start the 72 hour hold until I signed, so I did. I'm not sure if that's legal.

I was later sent a bill for over $17,000 from the hospital. I received another bill for the two psych doctor I saw. Combined, they spent 15 minutes with me, I was billed for an 1 hour for each. The bill was for over $2,500.

To summarize: I'm being grossly overcharged and I did not have insurance at the time. I also am clueless if telling me they would hold me until I signed.

Do I have any legal recourse?

Personal note: I'm aware that what I tried to do was selfish and wrong. I know that there are consequences to my actions and that I rely too much on doctors when I should be fixing my issues myself.

"So, not my story, but one my grandmother told me a few months ago.

My grandmother is in her early 60, and just about the sweetest person you could know. That being said, if you tick her off, she can take a complete 180 and well... Yeah. Anyway, she has worked in retail for the past several years (big book store) as a manager, and does everything from stocking to cleaning to working registers plus some.

The story comes when she was out with her sisters one day at the mall. They had been out having fun and went into a department store. It hit my grandmother she needed to use the restroom badly, so she sped to the nearest one she could find. Well, based on the title, you kind of get where this is going.

She opens the door and sees a man washing his hands and keeps walking in. With her years of retail work, she thinks its a janitor and says something along the lines of ""Sorry sir, I know you are just doing your job, but I've worked in retail for a while and have had to deal with the same stuff.

At this point, she said it hit her that something was wrong. The man didn't say anything back, and as she went further in, saw the urinals.
In complete embarrassment, she stopped dead in her tracks, turned around, and asked the man ""You don't work here do you? And this isn't the women's restroom is it?""

"I'm on mobile so please forgive formatting and errors. 


Let me preface this by saying this happened almost a year ago. Also I worked in restaurants from the time I was little until I was about 23. I literally lived above the restaurant my grandparents owned when I was kid. Customer service is something I proudly excel at. I have been invited to weddings, have had customers wait 20 minutes just so I would be their server. I've made many friends from old crazy men to kids who loved it when I would do card tricks and juggle for them while their parents ate. I met one little boy who was blind from a tumor and his mom told me he would ask to go out to eat just to interact with me. I've always treated others how I've wanted to be treated and I've gone out of my way to take care of customers everywhere I worked. There's just something that makes me happy when i know I've taken good care of someone and they give me a genuine thank you. I'm now in US Army as a cavalry scout. And that's where our story begins.


My troop went out to eat to celebrate my graduation from bc and move into the ait portion of OSUT. We went to a local museum that had a restaurant in it. The waiter was an ass. He answered a phone call in the middle of me ordering. Never refilled my drink. Charged me twice for my meal. Was rude to all(6) of us at the table. This was our first social interaction in weeks and it sucked. I was over it. He came by with the check and said if we didn't leave a tip that he would take our names and tell our drill sergeants. I had overheard him threaten another table with the same thing and I couldn't believe it. I was like who tf does this guy think he is? I worked in food service and would never say that to anyone. I had already put $2 on the table when i jokingly asked, ""has it been that kind of night?"" i shit you not good guy says, ""yeah, I've been getting stiffed all night, and did you know that $2 is an unacceptable tip for a $24 tab? "" this motherfucker. I understand getting stiffed. I've been there before, but you can't treat every table shitty because you're having a bad night. That's probably why he was getting stiffed. I told him that I tip based on service and I had shitty service so he gets a shitty tip. He asked how and i explained answering your phone when someone is ordering would have gotten you fired at any restaurant i have ever worked at. Never refilled my drink. Double charged for my meal and wouldnt fix it until i asked someone else to. Overall you were rude and unprofessional. I picked my tip up, wrote (my last name) in big letters on a piece of paper and told him he was more than welcome to give my name to the Drill sergeants. Everyone else at my table agreed with me and picked up their tips. This guy was an ass. This was the worse service i had ever received anywhere. Saw something on FB that reminded me of this experience so I thought I would share.

"I'm following this as curriculum [https://teachyourselfcs.com/](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) and it's awesome.

1 \- Don't just learn a language, learn how to program. Syntax won't help you if you don't think correctly on how to approach a problem. The best way to this imo is to hit up a college intro course to programming, there are a lot online and they emphasize on programming concepts instead of languages. Learning a language after those course is a peace of cake. And if you want a deeper understanding of programming languages you can continue by studying compilers and how programming languages are made. Avoid udemy unless it's a renown teacher. every random people on this planet  that thinks they can teach can post a course there, it doesn't mean you will learn well from them.

2 \- LEARN MATHS. Seriously LEARN MATHS, from scratch if you need to, it's fine. Programming and computer science are just applied mathematics. You can get away with simple math and not knowing much, but you'll be a way better programmer if you have a good understanding of math. Why you may ask? Because math is pure logic thinking in order to solve problems, and you need that logic thinking, it helps you think differently on how you can approach a problem in order to solve it ... Don't think that you can't do it or that you sucked at school, the brain is a muscle you can work it out, just start with the basics and go on from there. If you're bad it's not your brain or maths' fault, it's yours for learning it incorrectly and not giving it more time and attention.

3 \-  Don't worry about getting a job, worry about how you can be a better programmer, if you are good jobs will be easy to find \(I already have offers and I didn't look for a job\) just by networking, going to meetup and so on ... so work on yourself so you can be better and this apply to everything not just programming.

4 \- Finally don't count on your motivation, it will fade away really really fast. What you need is ""DISCIPLINE"". Keep it up everyday, set some rules you have to follow. Tell your surroundings about your rules so they can call you up if you don't respect them so you can get back at learning again. Trust me it will be worth it ...

Good luck, and thanks to this awesome community. Free education is gold, but you know what? People who help each other to learn more and improve are better ...

"Old post still relevant 

I got downvoted in this sub for saying straight guys aren't obsessed with gay sex and the guy who said they are got a bunch of up votes...listen queens stop it. I use to be like that hopeful and wishful and clinging on to the ideology that ""no one is 100% straight"" like I hear a lot in this sub . It's just not true . Straight men sometimes might randomly talk about it but gay sex is not on there mind. Women are...getting pussy... Maybe even their girlfriends and marrying them and being with them. You are most of the time NOT on there minds . STOP wishful thinking . Wishful thinking is what got me humiliated a week before prom thinking a straight guy would go with me (check my previous posts) wishful thinking is what breaks so many gay men hearts when they believe in all this Kinsley scale sexuality spectrum bullshit . If you're hooking up with a ""straight guy"" on the dl he is not straight so don't even try using that as an excuse in the comments in fact you are so undesirable to them that gay men actually PAY STRAIGHT MEN TO BLOW THEM. Get use to the fact that you will end up with a gay man.. You are only desirable to a gay man.

"Once a week I always take my grandmother out shopping. Without sounding too sappy - it‚Äôs one of the highlights of my week. Being that she is getting older and it is hot down where I live, I always try to find a spot that is close to the store and is in the shade. 

We drove the short drive to the store and amidst the crowded parking lot there was a prime parking spot open right under a tree, mere feet from the store. I stop at the crosswalk and wave on a woman, looked about mid-30‚Äôs, had the ‚ÄúCan I speak to the manager‚Äù haircut, those oversized ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù sunglasses - in short, she looked like a typical Karen. 

So after I wave Karen on she goes to her Ford Expedition that was right next to the spot I was going to park in. As I begin to turn into the row where the parking spot is, Karen parks her cart right in front of the parking spot. 

I checked to make sure I wasn‚Äôt blocking traffic and patiently waited as she didn‚Äôt have much stuff. Finally she closed her trunk, looked at me dead in the eyes, and left her cart to block the parking space. 

My grandmother insists on getting out and just taking that cart to the store. I comply and she makes her way into the store and I park. Now that could‚Äôve been the end of the story - I could‚Äôve just gotten out of my car, gone into the store and been on my way...

...But cue Karen. 

When I got out of the car she rolled her window down and snapped: ‚Äúyou could‚Äôve parked somewhere else you know.‚Äù 

I just looked at her and sarcastically said ‚Äúcool.‚Äù Then proceeded to the cart return, took a shopping cart, and parked it behind her car. 

As I locked my car and walked to the store she honked the horn a few times and flipped a couple birds at me, she frustratedly got out of her car and pushed the cart behind my car. To further mess with her I pushed the panic button on my key fob so the alarm would go off after I saw her push the cart. She runs out of her car again and puts the cart back into the cart return. 

Another successful Tuesday shopping trip with my grandma. 

TL;DR: Unpleasant lady blocks my parking spot in a busy parking lot with a cart, in return I block her car and scare her with my car alarm when she attempts to retaliate.

"As previously revealed on Inside Survivor, the thirty\-eighth edition of the long\-running reality\-show will feature four returning Survivor castaways competing against 16 brand new players. The season is currently filming in Fiji‚Äôs Mamanuca Islands and is scheduled to air on CBS in early 2019.

Below are the **four former castaways** who will return on Season 38.

* Aubry Bracco
* David Wright
* Joe Anglim
* Kelley Wentworth

Aubry most recently competed on Game Changers in 2017 where she came in 5th place; it was her second appearance on the show after finishing runner\-up on Kaoh Rong in 2016.

Kelley will also be making her third Survivor appearance having been a pre\-merge boot on San Juan Del Sur in 2014 before returning on Cambodia ‚Äì Second Chance in 2015 where she made it all the way to 4th place.

Joe is another two\-time Survivor veteran, having reached the jury on both Worlds Apart and Cambodia in 2015. He‚Äôs also familiar with Kelley as they both made the merge in their second season ‚Äì Kelley ultimately voted him out on Day 32.

David is the only one of the four returnees to have played just once before. He was voted out in 4th place on Millennials vs. Gen\-X in 2016 because he was considered a huge favorite to win.

It‚Äôs not yet clear how the tribes will be divided, whether the cast will be split into four tribes of five with one returnee on each or if there will be two tribes of ten with a pair of returnees on each in a sort of ‚Äòco\-captains‚Äô format.

Stay tuned to Inside Survivor over the coming weeks for more information.

"I've been living in poverty my entire life. My family of 7 didn't eat breakfast unless we could afford a box of Kix, usually skipped lunch, and then shared a box of Kraft dinner between ask of us. If you were still hungry after that, my mom would break out the Top Ramen packs. I didn't try most of the vegetables I love now until I was an adult. You bet I'm overweight because my entire diet consisted of awkward fasting and carbs. 

We lived in a 2 bedroom apartment, all the kids in one room. My mom was a casino dealer (who often tried to gamble her tips at the end of her shift) and my step dad was a deadbeat. 

I'm now 27, and I've been carrying the debts and horrible spending habits my entire adult life. But recently, as in this month recently, people have been actually commissioning artwork from me, and all of a sudden I have enough in my accounts to pay off my credit cards and collections notices. I have 1 credit card left to pay off. It's down to $1000 and I'm honestly in shock. I'm so close, and there's this part of me that's kind of afraid to feel what it feels like to not be in debt. Being in debt has been my main motivation to making money in the first place. It's a constant pressure in the back of my mind, that generally keeps me going. So what will be my motivation in the future? 

*Edit 1*: I'd like to mention that I didn't mean what should I physically do next (I actually work for a financial advisor so I know about the 6-months savings / retirement funds, etc. Working for her has helped me learn SO MUCH about spending habits and steps to climb out of the hole). I mean *emotionally*, how do I handle being out of debt? If that makes sense. Debt is comfortable to me, I'm used to it. My partner says it sounds like I've built some kind of Stockholm syndrome around my debt.

I'll figure it out. Regardless of all the worries, I'm *so close* and **super excited**.

"I was eleven and the world was safe. 


It was four o‚Äôclock on a Wednesday in April. I was the only person home, same as most weekdays. And, same as most weekdays, I was leashing up our lhasa apso, Bumble, for his walk. He was big for his breed, although still a small dog, and I had to hurry along behind him as he tugged me excitedly to the front door. It was a cool, sunny afternoon, and we set out at a brisk pace in search of adventure.


Adventure meaning one go around the block with a pause at all the yards so Bumble and the neighbor dogs could trade a good sniff. 


There‚Äôs only so much you can expect from a quiet, middle class neighborhood.


We were paused in front of the Paolas‚Äô to let Bumble say his hellos to their bully mix, Peanut, when I realized there was a car idling just up the street from us. I glanced at it without much interest. It was an SUV, looked like it was newish, the kind of car a ton of the soccer moms in my neighborhood drove. I thought they might be waiting for me to cross the street and gave a little wave for them to pass.


The car crept slowly forward and I turned back to the dogs. Bumble was pawing at the ground and Peanut had reared up to stand on her hind legs, her front paws hooked over the top of the fence so I‚Äôd reach over and pet her.


I don‚Äôt think any of us had time to realize what was happening before a hand was shoved roughly over my mouth and I was being yanked backwards. Instinctively, my grip on Bumble‚Äôs leash tightened and I squirmed as hard as I could while my dog, pulled suddenly off balance, turned and began to bark. 


The SUV, still running, had come to a stop behind me.


‚ÄúGet her in!‚Äù A woman said from the front seat.


‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt let go of the damn dog!‚Äù A man, the one who had hold of me, hissed back.


While I struggled, my usually docile and gentle Bumble leapt at my attacker, snapping his teeth and snarling with all the ferociousness his small body could muster. Peanut was jumping at her fence, her head thrown back in deep, rumbling barks.


‚ÄúThen kill it and get her in here!‚Äù


Bumble yelped so sharply when he was kicked that every hair on the back of my neck stood on end. He crumpled against the ground for a moment, but was pushing himself back up almost immediately and readying to charge again with a pained growl. As terrified as I was, I couldn‚Äôt bear to see my sweet boy hurt again and I threw his leash down as I was hauled backwards. 


The car door slammed behind me. I was thrown to the floor and the SUV peeled noisily away. It was over in seconds.


‚ÄúStay down there,‚Äù the one who‚Äôd grabbed me said. His voice was cold with warning. ‚ÄúIf you move or make a sound, we‚Äôll go back and run your puppy over. It‚Äôll be all your fault. Got it?‚Äù


I swallowed the jagged sob that threatened to choke me and curled up with my face in my hands. 


*Don‚Äôt hurt Bumble,* I pleaded silently. *Don‚Äôt hurt me.*


‚ÄúDid anyone see?‚Äù The driver asked.


‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so. I didn‚Äôt see anyone.‚Äù


‚ÄúGood.‚Äù


The inside of the car smelled like the one we‚Äôd rented when we‚Äôd gone out west to visit Grandma. Plasticy and perfumed. The carpet was scratchy against my cheek, but I didn‚Äôt dare to move or complain. I could barely bring myself to breathe. I didn‚Äôt know what to think or even if I *could* think. The inside of my head has been painted bright white with fear. The only thing that managed to cut through it were the same six words and my dog‚Äôs agonized yelp.


*Don‚Äôt hurt Bumble. Don‚Äôt hurt me.*


My eyes burned with tears and suddenly I was shaking uncontrollably. A warm puddle formed beneath me, but I just laid in it. How often had I been warned at home and at school about stranger danger? They had told us all about what we should do if we thought we were being followed or someone was making us uncomfortable.


Nobody tells you what to do *after*.


‚ÄúWe need to pull over and swap license plates,‚Äù I heard the man say.


‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the woman replied. She was obviously on edge. ‚ÄúNot yet. We‚Äôre still too close. Let‚Äôs get up the highway a bit.‚Äù


They kept talking. First arguing about whether to change the license plate, then about when and where they were meeting someone. Something about a hand off and money and getting me across the border before my face was all over the news. I didn‚Äôt know what any of it meant. I was being crushed beneath an overwhelming wave of fear and confusion.


I just wanted to go home. I just wanted my mom and my dad and Bumble!


The piercing wail that burst uncontrollably out of me filled the vehicle.


‚ÄúShut her up,‚Äù the woman said.


The man leaned low in his seat until his face took up my entire vision. ‚ÄúYou make one more sound and I‚Äôll cut your tongue out. Oh, shit, Gemma, she pissed herself.‚Äù


‚ÄúWe‚Äôll deal with it later. Just keep her down and quiet. Stop sign coming up; I can‚Äôt run it. We can‚Äôt risk it.‚Äù


I was nudged roughly with the toe of his shoe and he wrinkled his nose in disgust. 


The SUV rolled to a stop and the couple sat in a tense silence. Right before we started to move again, I heard a familiar, but distant bark somewhere behind the car. It was accompanied by a deeper, rumbling one.


The man twisted in his seat. ‚ÄúHer dog‚Äôs following us. The other one, too.‚Äù He sounded almost amused. ‚ÄúBack over them.‚Äù


‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be a fucking idiot,‚Äù Gemma said tersely.


*Don‚Äôt hurt Bumble. Don‚Äôt hurt me.*


The sound of Bumble and Peanut‚Äôs barking faded as we turned a corner and I hugged my knees to my chest, trying once again to keep the scream that was flooding my lungs from escaping.


The general hum of traffic told me we‚Äôd merged on to a main road. Probably the one right outside of my neighborhood. Gemma was becoming more agitated and kept muttering about how busy it was. The man was also fidgety and there was a line of sweat glistening on his upper lip. He wiped the sleeve of his jacket over it repeatedly, but it just reappeared again almost immediately. 


At some point, he‚Äôd pulled out a pocket knife and was flipping the blade in and out and in and out with a nervous twitch of his fingers.


He caught me staring up at him and pointed its tip down at me. ‚ÄúOne sound, one move,‚Äù he threatened.


A surge of nausea sprang from my stomach and I almost vomited my terror right on his shoes.


‚ÄúWhy are we going so slowly?‚Äù Gemma was anxiously drumming the steering wheel. ‚ÄúWe have to be at the depot in two hours. They won‚Äôt wait, not even for a blonde girl.‚Äù


‚ÄúThey will. You know how much a kid like this gets them.‚Äù


A kid like this? I didn‚Äôt know what he meant, but the look he gave me was enough to let me know it was anything but good. I bit down on the inside of my cheek and reburied my face beneath the shelter of my arms. 


The traffic slowed around us until we were crawling along. Gemma cursed continuously under her breath. The man played with his knife. The metallic sliding noise it made with each click of its release sent ice rippling down my spine. My face was wet and sticky from my runny nose and eyes. The puddle beneath me had grown cold. I still didn‚Äôt move. I just stared up at the knife, watching its blade.


In and out, in and out.


There was a loud slam against the back door beside the man and all three of us jumped. A loud, long series of scrapes, like nails on a chalkboard, followed. 


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that fucking dog,‚Äù the man growled. 


Outside his window, Peanut growled back and continued to claw at the door.


Metal crinkled and groaned from up front and Gemma laid on her horn.


‚ÄúWhat the hell,‚Äù the man demanded while Peanut howled at him through his window.


‚ÄúA dog is trying to take off the front bumper!‚Äù 


‚ÄúRun it over!‚Äù


‚ÄúWhere the fuck do you want me to go? We‚Äôre stuck here!‚Äù


While they argued, the car bounced slightly in the front. Gemma shrieked and there were scratching sounds against the windshield, as if something was trying to get in. A deep throated growl resonated through the glass. The couple screamed at each other, at the dogs attacking the car, and at me for breaking down. 


‚ÄúPeople are looking!‚Äù Gemma yelled. Desperation was seeping into her voice.


And somehow, over it all, I heard that same familiar bark that woke me every morning from outside my bedroom door. The same one that greeted me when I got home from school every day. The same one that had chased us here unrelentingly. 


In the confusion, I pushed myself upright enough to see over the dashboard. A large German Shepherd was standing with his front paws on the windshield. His head was lowered, ears pinned back, and he was staring into the car with teeth exposed. I caught a flash of his distinct neon green and orange collar. Tavi, the corner neighbor‚Äôs dog.


Behind him though, visible through his legs, Bumble was standing squarely in the middle of the road in front of the SUV. 


He was panting hard, visibly trembling even from a distance, but he was still barking. Still trying to get to me.


Peanut threw herself at the man‚Äôs door again. The dog at the front bumper was obviously making some progress from the crunches that shook the car, and Tavi paced back and forth on the hood of the car. 


If traffic hadn‚Äôt been at a complete standstill already, it was now. Hesitantly, the driver of the car in front of us stuck his head out his window. He had his cell phone up, recording. The car next to us cracked their passenger window.


‚ÄúY-you ok?‚Äù I barely heard the little old lady inside shout.


But I heard her nonetheless, and it made me realize she could hear me, too. 


Gemma and the man were distracted with trying to placate the other drivers. It was only momentary, a seconds long slip up in attempt to stave off more attention. With a fleeting glance at the man‚Äôs knife, tucked out of sight of the window, I coiled my legs beneath me and lunged at the door. 


‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù I was screaming before I‚Äôd even gotten it open. ‚ÄúHelp! I don‚Äôt know them! Help!‚Äù


There was a scramble behind me and I was half hanging out of the car, frantically clinging to the side of it while the man yanked at my ankles. He and Gemma were yelling at me, cursing, threatening, but people were starting to get out of their cars and I just kept howling.


I recognized Baxter as he rounded the car door from the front, where he‚Äôd been chewing up the bumper. He was a distinct mutt: brindle, with the hanging jowls of a hound dog, and huge. He lived a street over from us and we often found him napping peacefully in the sunniest spot in his yard on our walks. 


As he jumped on me, knocking the wind out of me, and launched himself off my back, he was anything but peaceful.


The hold on my ankles immediately fell away and there was snarling, snapping, and screeches so terrified and agonized from both the man and Gemma that I froze up.


Hands hooked themselves under my armpits and pulled me from the car. A man was holding me, asking me for my name, my address, but I just sank from his grip to the ground, screaming and crying. Onlookers had surrounded us and were trying to call the dogs, especially Baxter, off.


It was only when Bumble, still shivering with exhaustion, crawled into my lap and started to lick my cheeks, that they began to relax. Fear of them quickly gave way to admiration and affection as they came to lie beside me with wagging tails and relaxed, lolling tongues.


Gemma tried to escape the car, but she was pushed back in by some of the crowd and her door was held shut. The man made no attempt to get out. I just heard his low, suffering groans from the backseat. Still alive, but obviously unwell.


I was able to point to Bumble‚Äôs tags, where our home address and phone number were listed, and phone calls were made. The same man who‚Äôd pulled me out of the car carried me to a bench at the side of the road, where Peanut, Tavi, and Baxter sat at my feet. Bumble remained perched on my legs while we waited for the cops and my parents to show up. 


An ambulance had to be called as well. I overheard someone say that it didn‚Äôt look like the man would have much of an arm left. Even then, I wasn‚Äôt upset about it. 


I didn‚Äôt know what human trafficking was, or that sometimes bad people kidnapped little girls to sell them off and send them far away from home. Because of Bumble and the others, it would be a long time before I ever even learned the term or found out what the couples‚Äô intentions had been.


My parents certainly didn‚Äôt tell me. Not then, anyway.


What they *did* tell me was that lhasa apsos are an ancient breed. A guardian breed. They were used in Tibetan temples as an alarm system of sorts. If someone were to break in, the lhasas were the first line of defense. Their job was to bark. And then it was their companions, the Tibetan mastiffs‚Äô, job to answer the call and take care of business.


Just like Bumble had somehow alerted the dogs around the neighborhood, who‚Äôd jumped fences and snapped their tethers to follow him.


Bumble was far removed from his ancestors and their holy homes. He was a lap dog who enjoyed being carried over people‚Äôs shoulders and having his ears scratched and eating scraps snuck to him under the dinner table. He was a little, chubby mop with legs who hid from thunder and ran from the vacuum. He was the family baby.


But when I had been in danger, Bumble had been every bit the guardian I needed him to be.


Because of him, when I was eleven, my world was saved.",33,1527818414.0,8nkkjn,335,Guardian Breed,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8nkkjn/guardian_breed/,2018-05-31 22:00:14

"I'm a little freaked out about posting my face on the internet, but I hope I can help someone else out who is struggling today

[Before and After - 50 Days Sober](https://imgur.com/a/ihw4f7R)

I took the before picture on my way to my first AA meeting. Believe it or not, I *am* wearing makeup in the before picture! (Foundation, powder, mascara) My skin was just so blotchy, red, and bloated from swigging vodka in the car while drinking two to three bottles of wine a day!! What a life, huh?

I gained a lot of weight while drinking- around 35lbs (and I'm pretty short). I used to run around 30 miles a week before I decided I cared more about drinking than I did about fitness. Binge eating and drinking went hand-in-hand for me. 

The weight doesn't come off over night, but for the first time my clothes are getting looser and looser while I'm eating candy and ice cream like it's Treat Yo' Self 2018. I'm starting to get more serious about my diet and exercise (because I know it will make me happy), but for now I am letting myself enjoy my short *very* slow jogs followed by whatever snack I want. Whatever keeps me sober!!

Getting sober is the best gift I have ever given myself. After multiple legal problems, crashing my vehicle, and fucking up all my relationships I didn't think there was hope for me: I was ashamed of myself. I don't feel that way any more. Even at 50 days in, I feel so damn hopeful about the future, even if it's a little scary. 

If you're struggling, earnestly reach out for help and you will receive it. I personally have chosen AA, and I go every day. Being sober is so much easier when you're not doing it on your own. In AA, I've met an amazing community of people who I now call friends and feel more loved than I ever had. I don't really believe in god (atheist), but I do believe in MY god which I found in AA: **G**roup **O**f **D**runks.

"First off, a big congratulations are in order for everyone in this sub. The passion and fervor that was displayed here over the past few weeks was nothing short of amazing. Sending the Roci to the edge of space and flying a plane over Amazon Studios are no small feats to accomplish in a year, let alone a few weeks. I‚Äôm proud to say that I was a small, small part of it.

With that being said, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre wondering why these reports matter anymore \(spoiler: they don‚Äôt\). For starters, this is the last season we‚Äôll get ratings reports for the show. Amazon doesn‚Äôt reveal viewing numbers, so we‚Äôll never see those again. Secondly, this show basically got a massive Reddit hug, which, [as this user mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/8m7qb4/jeff_bezos_announced_amazon_has_officially_picked/dzlhq9h/), has resulted in more free advertising and PR for The Expanse than SyFy ever gave it. There‚Äôs a real chance this show keeps up its hockey stick growth and blows the doors off ratings/viewing wise for its season finale. And lastly, I genuinely love this stuff and enjoy sharing it with this fanbase. I‚Äôve received great response to my other reports and, frankly, don‚Äôt feel like stopping. Ok, now that we‚Äôve gotten the sentimental stuff out of the way, it‚Äôs time to hitch your tits and pucker up because it‚Äôs time to peel the paint.

# 

# Report

Let‚Äôs get this out the way right now: The Expanse had one hell of a night. I‚Äôll go into why down below, but the fact that it‚Äôs getting close to season premiere numbers mid\-season is nothing short of amazing. It‚Äôs obviously been helped by the massive PR push and recent Amazon acquisition, but these are the best mid\-season numbers The Expanse has had since January 2016.

As always, let‚Äôs start with the show and network. [The Expanse earned a 0.20¬π rating and 609K viewers last night](http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-wednesday-cable-originals-network-finals-5-30-2018.html), which is basically a repeat of two weeks ago \(03x06, 0.19 rating & 609K viewers\). Additionally, this was the first week that The Expanse didn‚Äôt have competition on SyFy, since Krypton had its season finale last week. Despite this, The Expanse pulled in its third straight week of 600K\+ viewers, the first time it's done that since season one \(\*December 14, 2015 \- January 12, 2016\).

TV landscape wise, it performed exceptionally well. Last week, The Expanse was ranked #42 in the top 150 original cable telecasts. Last night, it was ranked #34. If you‚Äôre wondering why last night‚Äôs numbers are good, the show benefited from a pretty barren prime time landscape. Most broadcast network shows had their season finale‚Äôs last week \(ex. Survivor, Empire\). Additionally, the NBA Finals start *tonight*, not last night \(that‚Äôs beyond lucky by the way\) so The Expanse‚Äôs only main competition was game 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals and a slew of terrible reality TV shows. However, the show got lucky again because games 2 and 3 of the Stanley Cup Finals are broadcast on NBCSN, NBC‚Äôs sports cable network. So, to recap: The Expanse missed the ratings juggernaut that is the NBA Finals by one day, missed the Stanley Cup Finals because it was on cable instead of broadcast, and was essentially all alone in the prime time original scripted category because everyone had their season finale last week. I honestly can‚Äôt think of another show that‚Äôs this lucky.

Performance wise, The Expanse is now having its third straight week of 600K\+ viewers, which, without sounding like a broken record, is amazing mid\-season. It completely blew 2017‚Äôs 02x08 out of the water, which had a rating of 0.13 and 460K viewers. Additionally, while that bump can be attributed to more fans watching the show live, I honestly believe the massive Reddit hug drew a completely new audience to The Expanse. That‚Äôs good news for Amazon as it‚Äôll look to market this show to as many audiences as possible when it finally moves to Amazon Prime Video.

Moving forward, definitely expect to see a viewings dip next week. While The Expanse might‚Äôve avoided both major sporting broadcasts last night, it‚Äôs going up against game 3 of the NBA Finals next week. Also, summer television is in full swing, so crappy TV shows, such as America‚Äôs Got Talent and The Bachelorette, are now on the air. Regardless, the show is doing very well considering everything it‚Äôs gone through over the past few weeks. Moreover, since it‚Äôs been bought by Amazon, it could have the worst ratings in history and still be OK, which is a position most shows would kill to be in.

# Other Observations

I, like many of the people on this sub, only watch the SyFy network when The Expanse is on. However, with the large spike in viewership over the past three weeks, I‚Äôd love to know whether SyFy has increased advertising on its network. It‚Äôs definitely an awkward position for SyFy, since The Expanse \(which they cancelled\) has outperformed Krypton \(\*[which got renewed for season 2](https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/krypton-renewed-season-2-syfy-1202818657/)\) over the past few weeks. So, if any of you watch the SyFy network occasionally, I‚Äôd love to know if you‚Äôve seen more advertisements for The Expanse.

Lastly, live\+7¬≤ numbers take about three weeks. It‚Äôs insanely long, however I know many of you have asked for those reports. Unfortunately, I get my reports from websites just like you, so, if TV By The Numbers doesn‚Äôt have those numbers posted, then neither will I. Additionally, sites like TV By The Numbers only report ratings and viewing numbers for the top 25 cable shows. If The Expanse isn‚Äôt in the top 25, there‚Äôs no report. Live\+7 for the week of May 14th should be available today \(finger‚Äôs crossed\) so if that report goes live, I‚Äôll add those numbers below.

\*Also, big shout\-out to The Americans, which had its series finale last night. It's honestly one of the best shows I've seen in a long time and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has Amazon Prime.

# Definitions

¬πA rating is defined as the percentage of the entire population of TV equipped homes that tune in to watch a show.

¬≤Live\+7 ratings measure live viewing, DVR, and VOD up to seven days later. They are usually available 2\-3 weeks after the broadcast from Nielsen.

"I recently got a job working in customer support for an electricity company. It's a lovely job, my coworkers are awesome, and so is my boss. Even most of the customers are pretty nice! It's a pretty sweet 9-5 job. 

Today i had my first prank call. I knew immediately that it was a prank call, because the voice on the phone sounded exactly like my brother when he's mocking me - I.E a teenageboy trying to speak with a female voice. 

The conversation went somewhat like this:

Hello, this is generic electricity company, what can i help you with ?
 
> Hello, this is Edith, please help me, there's feces everywhere.

.... Excuse me ? 

> Something is really wrong, there is poop everywhere, and it smells horrible, you have to fix it 

Maam, do you have a customer number or something else i can look you up on ? 

>NO, you have to send someone out and clean it up ! 

At this point i was pretty sure it was a prank call, because she didn't give me any information. 

So i said: Maam, this is an electricity company 

> Please just help, i don't know what to do with the poop. 

So my patience ran out. And i said

""I really don't have time for prank calls. Get a life, and stop waisting peoples time"". And then i hung up. 

Roughly 10 minutes Later, my coworker comes over to me, and asks whether i had just had a call from Edith. I said yeah, and he just kind of looked at me... 

Then he explained that Edith had called him in tears, and said that i had hung up on her. Apparantly Edith is an elderly woman with throat cancer, that makes her voice really high pitched and squeaky. As far as my coworker was informed, there had been some sort of leak when a sewage tank was supposed to suck something up from the sewers. There was, quite literally, poop everywhere. Poor Edith didn't know what to do, so she went inside, and looked at her electricity meter, assuming it had something to do with the water. So she called the number that was written on her electricity meter. 

Long story short, my boss called Edith and apologised profusely. I was on the phone with her, apologised, and explained the situation. Thankfully she thought it was kind of funny.

Our company is sending a nice gift basket her way, and that's the end of it. Fortunately, i'm not losing my job, since my boss has listened to the call, and he understood why i thought it was a prank call. 

I also kind of want to send Edith a personal apology gift. I don't have a ton of money, but i want to get her something nice, any ideas ?

"I went to a ‚Äúbusiness meeting‚Äù with a lifevantage rep because I wanted to hear what BS they were spouting. They started talking about their ‚Äúfool proof‚Äù business model and mentioned the IVY league schools teaching NWM. A quick google search equipped me with plenty enough information to call this guy out and man, did his colors quickly change.

He became very defensive and tried to label me as ‚Äúthat negative guy in the group‚Äù which only fueled my passion to ruin this guy‚Äôs presence in my town, starting with this group. Turns out, he literally knew nothing about this bogus company. All of the ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù was just memorized pseudo facts. The other people in the group initially thought I was simply an asshole, which I also totally embraced, and by the middle of my tirade, the dude basically folded and left his script. Once that happened, his audience totally changed. 

Meeting was supposed to last an hour but only ended up being 30 minutes. I feel like I helped 30 strangers that day.

"As I'm sure most here do, I constantly fight an inner battle of whether I'm good enough, whether my art is art, and especially whether it's even worth making, much less releasing. Most of the time I feel like I'm bothering the shit out of people and begging them to listen to my music. 

I never check the inbox on my Facebook artist page, because it gets absolutely no engagement or interaction, so two weeks after releasing a new EP, I stumble across a message from a writer for a city's newspaper/music blog, and he wrote a glowing review of it

Just knowing that there are people out there who would enjoy to hear my sounds without being begged to listen makes me feel like I can conquer the world, and makes me feel (at least temporarily) worthwhile of making more music

"Greetings, Reddit! I‚Äôm Tony Wheeler, and I founded Lonely Planet in the 1970s. In the beginning, I was a backpacker with a dream, passion for travel, and 27 cents to my name. Years later, Lonely Planet has grown into the largest guidebook publishing house in the world.

For years, I‚Äôve worked closely with organizations to save historic sites throughout the world. Heritage preservation is a precarious business, and our world‚Äôs most vulnerable places can always come under risk. The news has recently been flooded with headlines about ongoing damage to heritage sites. Whether it‚Äôs iconic world treasures [damaged by pollution](http://time.com/5262395/taj-mahal-india-change-color-supreme-court/), unscrupulous [tourists stealing ancient artifacts](https://www.thelocal.it/20180514/tourist-fined-for-stealing-artefacts-from-pompeii), or the violent [destruction of irreplaceable monuments](https://stepfeed.com/remembering-10-arab-historical-sites-destroyed-by-daesh-2339), it seems that no historic structure or cultural tradition is safe from threats.

I think the passionate audience here on Reddit will agree that the loss of historic sites devastates our collective human history. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm passionate about conserving endangered sites and traditions for future generations of travelers, and the San Francisco-based [nonprofit Global Heritage Fund](http://globalheritagefund.org) is one of my favorite conservation organizations. Their unique approach empowers communities to take ownership of their own history and traditions, creating sustainable economic prosperity to support current and future generations.

I truly believe in the work that Global Heritage Fund is doing and have personally visited many of their project sites throughout the world. I‚Äôve trekked to [Ciudad Perdida](https://globalheritagefund.org/what-we-do/projects-and-programs/ciudad-perdida/), Colombia‚Äôs ‚ÄúLost City‚Äù that rivals Machu Picchu. I‚Äôve helicoptered to the Maya ruins of [El Mirador](https://globalheritagefund.org/what-we-do/projects-and-programs/mirador-guatemala/), Guatemala - [see a photo of me in the chopper here!](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbQZsZHFAtn/?taken-by=globalheritagefund) -  And I‚Äôve been awestruck by the majestic temples of [G√∂bekli Tepe](https://globalheritagefund.org/what-we-do/projects-and-programs/gobekli-tepe-turkey/), the oldest ritual site in the world.

I‚Äôm excited to share that we recently setup a deal for Lonely Planet to donate 30% of all online sales using the code GHF30 to Global Heritage Fund, now through June 19. [Check out our latest books here](https://shop.lonelyplanet.com/) and feel free to ask me about my travels. I look forward to your questions! Go ahead‚Ä¶AMA.

At this point, every time we had downtime I was using it to talk up the crew. All the crew members trusted little Danny whole-heatedly and would do anything for him. I started sowing distrust of the officers in the crew, knowing this moment may come.

>Tfw I use to be a simple silly performer.

>Tfw I'm now iron tyrant of one of the most powerful pirate ships in the seas.

>Don't trust halflings.


Story doesn't end there, but I don't know the rest of it, yet. Before folks ask, the captain's player was cool with this plan, we talked it over ahead of time. He's leaving for a few weeks and this seemed like a thematic send-off. Rest of the party had no idea. This just happened like last night, and I wanted to get all my thoughts together on it.

This had been months of planning, sending notes to the DM, hiding things from the party, having the DM step in and act like V to prevent suspicion, all sorts of things like this. Some players had suspicions, but we were careful to never outright confirm anything.

I don't think I'm ever going to be able to do anything to top this as a player ever again.",19,1527802104.0,8nien5,619,The Hellknight Kid,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/8nien5/the_hellknight_kid/,2018-05-31 17:28:24

"Even though I have $300\-$400K savings and a decent job, my best times was sharing a house with 5 other roommates and 2 of them were on welfare. 1 of them was a student and the other 2 were working minimum wage jobs.

Every other Friday, we would all go out, find the cheapest bar, order a drink or 2 and have great times.

At work, there are some colleagues that want to eat out at fancy restaurants every other day for lunch, and I'm thinking to myself, ""dammit Joe, I'm trying to save money here!""

"This is my .NET application for Windows that will display Twitch chat on top of a windowed or borderless windowed game. Typically would be used by single monitor streamers who need to see chat while playing. This application will attempt to always stay on top and it's fully transparent. You can move and resize the app as you need and you can control the app through a system tray icon. This app has been approved by the /r/Twitch mods.

[Screenshot 1](https://i.imgur.com/vDZiQDK.png)

[Screenshot 2](https://i.imgur.com/TOIVYkz.png)

-

You can download the app on github here:

https://github.com/baffler/Transparent-Twitch-Chat-Overlay/releases

Under ""Assets"" grab the file ""TwitchChatOverlay-v0.3.zip""

-

* Extract the zip file and open the folder and look for TransparentTwitchChatWPF.exe
* (Optional) right click on the application file and choose Send To > Desktop (create shortcut)
* After launching the program for the first time, you'll need to set your twitch channel by right clicking on the system tray icon on the taskbar
* You can move the application by clicking and dragging the thin black border at top, and you can resize it by clicking and dragging the grip at the bottom-right
* To hide the borders, just click the [o] button in the top-right, or use the system tray icon menu

-

Some known issues that I'm still working on. 

* You can't always click through the chat, usually it's fine anywhere in the transparent parts but clicking on text/emote will prevent you from clicking on your actual game that is behind it. 
* The resize grip on the bottom-right is a bit hard to click on.
* Doesn't work for fullscreen games, but it's probably something I won't be able to easily implement because it would require some type of DirectX hooking which is not my expertise.

"[Testosterone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone) is the primary male sex hormone that plays a key role in male well-being, from physical strength (bone strength and muscle mass) to sexual physical development. Attention, memory, and spatial ability are key cognitive functions affected by testosterone in humans. It is also crucial in promoting risk taking ability in humans. 

In short, Testosterone is the hormone that characteristically makes a man a man.

Since the 80s. the average T levels in men have been declining by 1% a year. That makes for a 30% loss today. Statistically speaking, the average man is 30% less of man than one 30 years ago! That's really significant. This drop affects all those things I've mentioned above that are critical for men's well being. 

Yet, we don't see it discussed all that often. The kicker is that it's still not fully understood. When controlling for all pertinent factors, the decrease in T-levels is still significant. Dietary choices are considered the most major factor, but to a layman like me, it feels like someday we will find about some bad chemical that's responsible and have a lead-in-water-wasnt-so-good-after-all moment.

I think we can say that decreasing testosterone levels are significantly harming the well-being of the average male in the west. How come nobody is talking about it? 

I think it's important to talk about the well-being of men in a society that increasingly demonizes masculinity. What do you guys think? Is this drop in testosterone levels a non-problem in your eyes? If not, what changes have you seen compared to earlier generations of men?

"My father was a psychiatrist with his own practice, and my mother worked as his ""receptionist."" She basically did everything else. Last year of high school, my father died. I was given his old cell phone number. I didn't think about it much, but it could have been a problem. It was only a problem once, during my first year of college, about 9 months later. 

I was working on homework in my dorm after classes. My phone rings, and it's somehow not my mom calling? I answer and it's a man who asks for my mom, I tell him she's not here and give him her cell number. He calls back a few minutes later saying she didn't answer, so I give him her home phone in case it was important. He calls me back again, angry this time, saying that didn't work either. I said I don't know what to tell you, I can't help you. He hangs up on me kind of abruptly, but I think nothing more of it.

Later on in the day, I receive a call from mom. She told me when this guy finally did get a hold of her, he said her secretary was very rude and unhelpful, and she should consider reprimanding me for my unprofessionalism. She tells him she doesn't know what he's talking about, no one works for her. In fact, there's not even a business anymore. He explains, and she tells him that he in fact did not talk to her secretary, but to her daughter. He immediately sputtered and backpedaled, trying to tell her I said I worked for her or some other nonsense. My mom tried to move on, but the guy kept insisting he wasn't the one who made the mistake. She never did find out why he had called.

I suppose you could say it wasn't unreasonable of him to think that, but I have no idea why he was calling my dad's number trying to talk to my mom.

"This is pathetic.

Original: https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/8ng6rq/apple_keeps_years_of_complete_browsing_history/

Some light reading:

https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/

https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/en/terms.html

Apple does not state that Safari syncing data is automatically deleted after 2 weeks. The ""2 weeks"" thing that this guy is alluding to is completely unrelated. A company called ElcomSoft was able to expose certain data on Apple devices using a vulnerability which, as far as I can tell, resembles a jailbreak. When you delete history from one device, Apple keeps a ""hidden"" copy of that record for up to two weeks, so that all devices have two weeks to sync the ""hidden"" copy in order to learn that the record has to be deleted from the ordinary history. This is a shortcoming of iCloud which allows up to two weeks of *deleted* data to be recovered.

I am suspicious of the fact that this guy never mentions in his series of a dozen tweets whether or not he ever deleted his history.

So what do we learn from this? If you **opt in** to a service where you **upload your complete browsing history** to a company **for nearly a decade**, and then you **neglect to manually delete the data from the service**, then the service is not going to read your mind and delete history which you no longer want and which you **explicitly told the service that you want saved**.

===============================================

Apple's privacy stance has enough issues that we can criticize it in an intellectually honest manner. You don't need to stoop to the level of using misinformation as propaganda to support your narrative. Step up your game, r/privacy.",41,1527811461.0,8njm1s,311,"r/privacy, please do some research before jumping to conclusions!

"Hi Mods

Can something please be done about the current state of the sub? 

I'm a frequent member of this sub and loved this sub. 

Unfortunately - 
This sub has made such a swift turn from being a super fun, hilarious, and relatively positive environment to a massive barrage of extremely Negative posts, Contestant and Lead hate comments, and discussions. 

Every post now is currently a negative and toxic circle jerk. 

This post is not about Spoiler opinions. Just about the current state of the sub that I loved up until a week ago. 

To quote another fellow member of this sub:
>I used to love this sub so much - the current state sucks so much.  It's become such a hateful circle jerk -- the amount of hate and vitriol used to discuss hate and vitriol is astounding

Possible SOLUTION: Can we perhaps make ONE mega thread about that particular spoiler discussions and opinions? Instead of seeing the same multitudes of opinions and posts every few hours. 


Edit: This post may be an unpopular opinion but I genuinely believe something needs to be done about this and this needs to be said. 

Edit 2: Discretion: My post title says no spoilers but people's comments might still contain spoilers",130,1527827636.0,8nlu2c,137,Dear Mods - Current state of the sub (No Spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/8nlu2c/dear_mods_current_state_of_the_sub_no_spoilers/,2018-06-01 00:33:56

"I was on a date with a girl I met on Tinder and things were going well enough. We wanted to go on a hike after lunch and decided to car pool on the way there. She asked if we could take her car, but that I would drive. ""Sure, why not."" \- bad decision.

We got pulled over for expired tags, cool. I tell the officer that it's her car, and at that point he starts ignoring me and takes all her information. He directs all conversation at her \- he takes her DL and when he returns, it's with a ticket. He says she doesn't have insurance either, but he gives me the ticket. I'm confused, because this is the first time I'm being brought into the whole situation. I have my own insurance, but he said I had to show up to court anyway because I was the driver.

The court date is some times in August, that's literally all I know. I'm no longer with the girl, but I've messaged her several times asking for the court date, time and room, but no response. I'm not sure what to do, any advice?

"At my wits end with a vendor over their shitty software.  It was recently revealed that their ""secret sauce"" database and software we pay $20,000/user/year for uses MS Access for the database back end.  Our database has grown to 160GB and is now constantly falling over and taking minutes to do any sort of transaction with a dozen users.   I'm currently speccing an ultra high end, high IOPS , low latency box to move the database over to since the vendor is currently telling our management VMWare is at fault.

Anything else I can throw at this?

Quick edit:  This software uses a custom backend to take client changes and write them out out to an abstracted access database. It is spread across about 200 access database files that are all linked together.   Changing out to SQL isn't possible because even if I could get the backend to interface correctly we would then be outside of support for all the other problems the software has.  However, I will pitch this to their team to see what we can do.

Said software is also an extremely niche R&D/scientific application.

"Hey everyone. Recently I posed an update on the missing children from Soul Asylum's Runaway Train video which you can read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/8n4qzu/updates_on_the_missing_children_from_soul_asylums/). Many versions of the video exist, however some have been taken down due to requests from the families of victims (most notably the Australian version which featured three victims of Ivan Milat). I've now gone through as many versions of the video as I could find and have provided updates for the remaining missing people which I did not cover in the first update, knowing full well that there are several versions which I have been unable to track down. Unfortunately in some cases it was exceptionally difficult to find any meaningful information at all, having no profiles on Doe Network, Charley Project or other similar database, perhaps suggesting that they were found/returned home/requested not to be looked for.


[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRtvqT_wMeY) is a link to the US video, and a link to the [Australian](https://vimeo.com/196389137) version (which does not contain the three women who were linked to Milat). I found a list of people who were featured in the UK video, however the video seems to be only available for viewing for a select few countries.


**People covered in the first thread**


Byron Eric Page

Christopher Kerze

Curtis Huntzinger

Dinah McNicol

Elizabeth Wiles

Mark Bartley

Martha Wes Dunn

Thomas Dean Gibson

Vicky Hamilton

Wilda Mae Benoit


**Resolved Cases**


Michelle Anne Farley was found alive shortly after the release of the video. Soul Asylum's guitarist Dan Murphy stated in an interview that Michelle met with the band, who stated 'You ruined my life' because she saw herself on the video at her boyfriend's house which led to her being forced back into an abusive home situation which she had willingly escaped from.


[Samantha Terese Knight](http://www.australianmissingpersonsregister.com/SamKnight.htm) went missing on August 19, 1986 from Bondi, Sydney Australia. Sixteen years later, Michael Guider, who was in prison serving 16 years for sexually abusing 11 children in Sydney, admitted to another prisoner that he had snatched Knight from Bondi and drugged her. He had planned to take photos of her but when he returned from the store, she was dead on his couch. Guider said he panicked and buried her body somewhere before moving it later on. He eventually pleaded to manslaughter and has yet to reveal the location of her body.


**Unresolved Cases**


[Anneke Nicolette Adriaansen](https://www.smh.com.au/news/national/coroner-declares-missing-couples-dead-after-27-years/2005/08/03/1122748703234.html) went missing on 12 January 1979 with her fiancee Alan Fox who is also missing. They were last seen in Byron Bay. The two were known to be hitchhiking at the time. After 27 years a Coroner in a Coronial Inquest declared them both legally dead, however their bodies have never been found. 


[Elizabeth Herfort](https://policenews.act.gov.au/news/media-releases/36th-anniversary-‚Äì-elizabeth-herfort-disappearance) was last seen on 13 June 1980 leaving the Australian National University Bar in Canberra, Australia. A person matching Herfort‚Äôs description was seen hitchhiking on the south bound carriageway leading to Commonwealth Avenue in Canberra. It is believed that this same person was then given a lift in a motor vehicle along Commonwealth Avenue to the intersection of Coronation Drive in Canberra. She has not been seen since. Tenuous links have been made to the disappearance of two nurses the night before Herfort‚Äôs in Parramatta, Sydney, although it is highly unlikely that the disappearances are linked. 


[Kevin Hicks](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4052178/Schoolboy-16-vanished-30-years-ago-going-buy-eggs-murdered-say-police-offer-20-000-reward-new-information.html) went missing on 2 March 1986 aged 16 in Croydon, South London. He told his parents that he was going to the local shop to buy some eggs for a home economics exam and left at 8:30pm. At 10pm a witness who knew Kevin saw him heading in the general direction of his house (notably, the store was only a 10 minute walk from the house, however this sighting of Kevin is 1.5 hours after he left). This is the last confirmed sighting of Hicks.
The CCTV in the shop was not working at the time and staff told police that they did not remember him visiting the shop that night. On 25 October 1996, a man called the local paper claiming that Hicks was dead and knew where his body was buried. Police were unable to trace the call and nothing eventuated from this lead. Police are now pursuing the theory that Hicks was murdered after having met someone who had been grooming him (a notable piece of ""evidence"" in the grooming theory is that some speakers were found which Hicks had been hiding from his parents, which is characteristic of people who have been groomed hiding gifts that they have received).

[Lee Boxell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Lee_Boxell) is an English schoolboy who went missing on 10 September 1988, aged 15, between Sutton High Street and Selhurst Park Football Stadium in London, England. On the day of his disappearance, Lee met with a friend to window shop before parting company, with Lee saying that he would be attending a football match later in the day. It was the last confirmed sighting of Lee. In 2012, a witness stated that Lee would occasionally attend an unofficial youth club in the annexe of St Dunstan's Church in Cheam known as The Shed. Following extensive enquiries, police discovered that paedophiles were operating in the area at the time Lee disappeared. Further, William Lambert, the St Dunstan's Church graveyard digger who ran The Shed, was jailed for 11 years in 2011 after sexually abusing four girls who attended the club. Coinciding with what would have been Lee's 40th birthday, a show called Crimewatch featured another appeal for information, working on the new theory that Lee attended The Shed on the day of his disappearance instead of the football match. Following this appeal, an allegation of sexual abuse was made which had never before been reported, and police are now working on the theory that ""Lee may have died after intervening to try to stop sexual abuse"" at The Shed.


[Louise Kay](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5582969/What-happened-missing-Louise-Kay-murdered-serial-killer-Peter-Tobin.html) has been missing since 1988 (aged 18) when she was last seen dropping off a friend in her dad's distinctive gold Ford Fiesta with one white door, after a night out in Sussex, UK. Police have suspected Peter Tobin in her disappearance, as he was living nearby at the time (it should be noted that police/investigators and amateur sleuths have attempted to link Tobin to a plethora of missing/murdered persons cases despite very tenuous links) Having said that, Tobin was charged with the murders of Dinah McNicol and Vicky Hamilton who were featured in Part One of this writeup. Search teams spent two weeks excavating areas in and around Tobin's former home in Brighton, with no evidence or links to Kay's disappearance being found. Interestingly, a lead Detective has stated publicly that Kay may be buried in a garden by a home not yet searched by police, stating ""Very sadly, the local ¬≠authority, who own the premises, won‚Äôt allow us to search the address."" The home was owned by Tobin at the time of Kay's disappearance.


**Not-so Resolved Cases**


[Ben Needham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Ben_Needham), a British child from Sheffield, UK went missing on 24 July 1991 at 21 months old on the Greek island of Kos. Comparisons have been made to the well publicised disappearance of [Madeleine McCann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann), both of whom have never been found. All searches have failed to locate Ben, and so was believed to have been kidnapped, possibly by Romani known to live in a camp not far from where he and his family were staying. A private investigator did find a young boy years later living amongst the Romani who resembled a more Anglo looking person than the Romani (he had blue eyes and blonde hair), however it was confirmed that this was not Ben. A ""breakthrough"" of sorts was made in September 2016, when police learned from a man from Kos that Kostantinos Barkas, a digger operator (now deceased), had told him that Ben had died in an accident (having been run over by Barkas who was operating a heavy vehicle on a construction site) and that he had hidden the body in building waste. Police began an excavation search and in July 2017 announced that traces of blood (a genetic ""profile indicative of human blood decomposition"") were found on a fragment of a sandal as well as on soil from inside a toy car, both items believed to have belonged to Ben. Whilst Ben has yet to be found, police are confident that the Barkas confession is accurate and the likely conclusion.


[Nicola Payne](https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/all-about/nicola-payne) went missing on 14 December 1991 from the Wood End Area of the SouthEast of London. Payne was on her way to her parents' house from her home and had a six month old son at the time of her disappearance. Police have ruled out Peter Tobin as a suspect. In 2016, two men, Nigel Barwell and his brother in law Thomas O'Reilly were found not guilty of her murder. On the afternoon of 14 December, a woman named Louise Sambrook reported to police that she looked out of a window and saw Barwell‚Äôs car near a path leading to the river Sowe; ‚ÄúStanding either side of the boot were Nigel Barwell and Thomas O‚ÄôReilly. Between them, partly on the lip of the boot, was what appeared to Sambrook to be a full black bin bag.""
‚ÄúThe prosecution suggest that Miss Sambrook was in fact observing the ground sheet of a tent that contained the body of Nicola Payne.‚Äù
Five days after Payne disappeared, a tent was discovered in undergrowth in Barnell's garden, and in 2014 when the tent was re-examined, hairs found in it were sent for analysis and, due to improved scientific techniques, were linked to Payne. Unfortunately the hair analysis was discounted in court. Detectives lost key pieces of evidence such as Payne's hairbrush. Further, the tent was incorrectly handled (not logged for one month and then stored for years in an unsealed bag) and so it was impossible to prove that there was no cross-contamination. It is believed that Barnell and O'Reilly are responsible for Payne's murder but escaped prosecution due to these technicalities.


**Cases which have little to no information**


* [Andrew David Robinson](http://www.australianmissingpersonsregister.com/AndrewRobinson.htm) went missing on 14 March 1989 age 29 from New South Wales, Australia. He left his Lawson home on foot telling his wife that he was going to a friend‚Äôs house. He has not been seen since. 


* Andy Gooch, missing 1992.


* Berenice Espinoza, missing 1992. An old Reddit thread has her listed as found (no other information). No source was listed.


* Billy Bennett, missing 1985.


* Christina Ann Wood went missing on 2 December 1991 from Live Oak, Florida aged 15. Wood has a tattoo of a heart on her left ankle and a 3-inch scar on her upper leg and is believed to be in the company of an adult male companion.


* Christina Herman, missing 1993.


* Darlene Michelle Hungerford, missing 1991. An old Reddit thread has her listed as found (no other information) and doesn't list a source.
Emily Tamara Pois missing since 1992 (as stated in the video). I found an [article](http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28275537/) for an Emily Tamara Pois, aged 36, missing since 2015. The article states that Pois suffers from ""several mental health issues"" and goes by her maiden name of Harnsberger. I also found a Phoenix arrest record for an inmate named Emily Tamara Pois in Maricopa Country Jail. Her date of birth is listed 9/28/1978, booking date 02/19/2017 on a count of shoplifting.


* Elenoa Isaia, missing 1992.


* Ginger Sue Hudson. I couldn't find any information on a Ginger Sue Hudson. The video claims she was last seen in 1992. Coincidently, I did come across a woman by the name of [Ginger MAY Hudson](https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/379) who has been missing since 1993. The photo from her NAMUS is slightly similar to the photo pictured in the video clip which appears at the 1:18 minute mark. According to NAMUS, Hudson was last seen by a city employee outsider her residence in Pittsburg, KS. When Hudson's boyfriend had arrived home later that day she was gone, but all personal items remained at the residence. I've also found a blog called [Missing Ginger](http://missinggingerhudson.blogspot.com/) which is run by her daughter. The blog makes no mention of Soul Asylum or the song, so i'm not sure if Ginger Sue Hudson is the same person as Ginger May Hudson.


* Heather Lee Yagle went missing on 7 February 1990 from Largo, Florida aged 16. There are records online indicating that a woman named Heather Lee Yagle was arrested in Hancock County, Mississippi aged 42 at the time of the arrest, otherwise there is very little information.


* Hsuan-Hua (Sharon) Huang, missing 1992.
[Mark Garvey](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases-int/398dmuk.html) went missing on 2 March 1987 aged 15 from Bootle, Merseyside following an argument with his girlfriend. Following this argument, Garvey told his girlfriend that he was going to the bus stop, which is the last time he was seen (there have been no reported sighting made at all since his disappearance). I could find no other substantial information relating to his disappearance.


* Jeffrey Peter Hiner, missing 1984.


* Kyle Wade Ducker, missing 1993.


* Ryan Keen-Coffield, missing 1991. All I can find is this [newspaper article](https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/120221775/) dated 21 July 1991. Unfortunately you need a subscription to access it. 


* Simon Darby, missing 1989.


* Susan Callam, missing 1993.


* [Tavanti Piras](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases-int/2330dmnsw.html) went missing from Castle Hill, Sydney Australia on 26 July 1990 aged 2. 


* Tristan Spencer, missing 1993.


* [Warren Long](http://www.australianmissingpersonsregister.com/WarrenLong.htm) went missing from Drummoyne, Sydney Australia on 15 March 1993 age 20. He was last seen leaving his place of work. It‚Äôs been noted that his car and a brief note were found at Watson‚Äôs Bay by his friends on March 17 1993 however I can‚Äôt find the contents of that note. Some sources have him erroneously listed as being missing since 2003. There have been possible sightings of him in Queensland. 


**Where to from here?**


I think it would be a great idea as a community to try and source information for the people listed above who have little to no information regarding their disappearance. This is a fantastic forum to bring some of these forgotten cases to light and to renew some interest in them. Understandably, some of the above mentioned people would have likely made contact with their families after the airing of the videos, or have wilfully not made contact.",41,1527794674.0,8nhmmw,674,Update on the missing children from Soul Asylum's Runaway Train: Part Two,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/8nhmmw/update_on_the_missing_children_from_soul_asylums/,2018-05-31 15:24:34
"When I was a teenager, my friends and I used to hang out at the local theater on weekends because we were still counting down to being old enough to drink in public. In fact, everyone who went to the three nearest high schools all hung out at the theater on weekends with their preferred groups.  

Though every era-appropriate subgenre of suburban 90s teens was represented on any given weekend night, the punk rock enthusiasts stood out from the rest. It is important to note that this distinction had nothing to do with our behavior--we were no more rambunctious than some other groups, but as far as appearance went, we looked like the extras from _The Road Warrior_ enjoying a perpetual smoke break.

For my part, in addition to a green bihawk, I had an old military jacket that I had dyed black and covered in spikes, studs, and band patches, the most prominent of which was a giant back patch that had been cut from an old t-shirt. It depicted an emaciated, skeletal humanoid with a Mohawk vomiting blood into a pile of dead babies. 

This period of my life is as close as I will likely come to understanding even a little bit what it feels like to be discriminated against based on my appearance. People in the Georgia suburbs generally reacted to my presence with suspicion, fear, and distrust wherever I went, and I reveled in it when it suited me. In a few years, I would learn that I could take off the jacket, along with the baggage that went with it, but as far as this story goes, we definitely aren‚Äôt there yet. 

Anyway, it was on a night like any other that the cop that patrolled the theater approached our group with definite purpose. D, one of my younger friends, had already started to get up. We knew the drill.

Even then, I had mixed feelings about law enforcement officers. In my experience, some of them did heroic work that saved lives, some of them took bribes to look the other way, and some of them singled out any difference and punished it any way they could, just like any bully would.

‚ÄúD, sit down,‚Äù I quietly but firmly commanded. If the cop saw this, he gave no indication. 

The cop said, ‚ÄúYou boys need to leave.‚Äù

D started to get up again.

‚ÄúD, sit down,‚Äù I said again.

D sat back down slowly, perhaps realizing that he was now at the edge of something, not in the middle.

‚ÄúYou heard me, right? You need to leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh? Why is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause you are loitering,‚Äù the cop said, exasperated at being challenged.

Then I did what was either the most or least punk rock thing I've ever done:

I looked up at him and said, ""Actually, according to Georgia Municipal Code section 16-11-36, loitering consists of acting in an evasive manner in the presence of law enforcement, refusing to identify ourselves, or manifestly endeavoring to conceal ourselves or an object.‚Äù

He looked at me like I just came down from outer space to swindle his mom out of her retirement fund. I continued:

‚ÄúNow you‚Äôre supposed to give us a reasonable opportunity to identify ourselves and explain or justify our presence and behavior.""

If it strains credibility to imagine a 17 year old saying that to a cop, I understand completely. I should mention, though, that we had been getting sent home early almost every weekend for almost a year by the same cop, while all of the other teens, from AC to Zack, were allowed to play out their curfews. 

At one point, the word went around my group of friends that the charge of loitering was specifically related to taking up commercial space without actively consuming anything, so we had adopted the habit of making sure we each had at least one dollar on us at all times to demonstrate our status as potential paying customers. 

This theory, unfortunately, broke down in practice: One night, upon being confronted by the cop, we attempted to present our dollars, but instead of hissing and vanishing like a Marxist vampire, he laughed at us and told us we needed to ‚Äúlearn more about the law.‚Äù

Thusly inspired to a new level of civic participation, I spent the rest of the night memorizing the relevant municipal ordinances pertaining to loitering for the next time the police confronted us, and I even practiced saying them out loud a few times. 

But I digress. 

The cop, having just been prompted to give us an opportunity to explain or justify our presence and behavior simply gave me a long, hard look and said, ""Are you a lawyer? Because I love throwing lawyers in jail.""

I gave him a long, hard look and said, ""No, I'm not _actually_ a lawyer, but this jacket fools everyone.""

He opened his mouth to say something, but instead just gulped a few times like a landed fish. The realization that he wasn‚Äôt psychologically prepared to turn a routine troublemaker sweep into an actual incident crossed his face, and he went back inside the theater.  

He never bothered us again.

TL;DR: A cop suggested I learn the law, so I came back to tutor him.

"I‚Äôve been dating my gf for over a year. She suffers from anxiety, but she has never seen a doctor until just recently. She constantly fights me and tears into me any chance something is little off for her. Didn‚Äôt text her back in a few minutes, I get yelled at. Didn‚Äôt text for an hour when I specifically told her I won‚Äôt be around because I‚Äôm with my friends and I won‚Äôt be near my phone, yelled at. She got into a huge fight with me over nothing while I was at my only brother‚Äôs bachelor and I had to handle that the entire weekend instead of celebrate with him. She had said some terrible things to me when she is upset, like ‚ÄúI regret ever being with you‚Äù ‚ÄúI would be much happier without you.‚Äù She blames it on her anxiety and said she loves me a lot. She is going to see a therapist now, but any chance she gets she still wants to fight me at any chance. I was texting her good night and I loved her. She asked to FaceTime and I called her right away, and she proceeded to yell at me that I didn‚Äôt want to FaceTime first. I apologized and apologized and the conversation ended with me saying i love you and she just hung up.

"We are less than one week away from the tollbooth opening.  I have done this post in the past and do believe that people on this sub get some good benefit from it, especially the Roo-kies. I know some on here may be tired of this post, my apologies.  I have gone to Bonnaroo every year since its inception.  I am also a local attorney and wanted to share details of the process for handling charges that keeps changing slightly year to year.  This is a place to ask questions you may have, and I will try to answer all that I can, and provide some helpful tips along the way.  As someone who loves attending bonnaroo and being part of the community there, I hope you don‚Äôt need this information, but it is here in case you do. 

Three years ago brought changes to the way criminal charges resulting from the festival were handled.  In years past, criminal citations and charges were treated differently during Bonnaroo. Typically, Defendants were sent a letter from the District Attorney‚Äôs Office and the Court Clerk indicating that with the payment of a fine, the charges would be dismissed or retired after a certain period of time.  The more serous the offense, the larger the fine assessed. 

While the official stance of Coffee County is that Bonnaroo case will be handled the same as every other case, what we found is that the process for festival offenses is still much different than the process used the rest of the year, and we expect the same or very similar this year.  

What does this mean for you? If you are arrested or cited for any criminal offense while you are in Coffee County for Bonnaroo, you will have to make regular court appearances OR have a licensed attorney appear on your behalf, and you will be prosecuted through the justice system.  

We understand that sometimes unfortunate things happen and at Bonnaroo it is usually a case of bad luck and timing rather than bad people or actions.  If you find yourself in this situation and need the assistance of an attorney, you can contact us at (615)896-4211, jhershman@mitchellattorneys.com or through our website at mitchellattorneys.com.  

We can work with you on fees and will try to minimize travel and costs for out-of-state clients.  The major benefit of retaining an attorney with knowledge of the system is most of the leg work and negotiation can be done prior to the first time you are required to be in court.  For most of our clients last year, they were only required to make one court appearance, and for others (depending on the charges and criminal history) we were able to completely avoid the need for their appearance in court.  Almost everyone we represented last year will be able to keep the conviction off of their record and have their charge expunged.  Every situation is different, but our knowledge of the local system and professional relationship with the District Attorney‚Äôs office will help ensure the most favorable result for your individual case. 

I will be on the farm experiencing Bonnaroo as always. Enjoy your time in Middle Tennessee and at Bonnaroo.

"Good morning, all. I'll start by saying that I've been a paramedic for about 15 years and I'm a regular at my local Starbucks. I am one of those customers who spends time in the cafe quietly working on their computer before or after work sipping a cold brew (venti, black, no room). Sorry for the long post, if it goes nowhere no worries!

This morning, another customer was getting up and down from her seat, walking up to other random people waiting for their drinks and saying, ""It's not like I'm a billionaire or anything!"" and simply, ""I have no money!"" She was perseverating, or repeating this over and over to many people as they would come and go. Her tone was slightly accusatory and had a tone of alarm, but not higher volume than conversational level. To further paint the picture, this woman was white, in her mid-30's and somewhat well dressed (she was also holding a tall iced coffee that another customer had purchased for her as she froze at the register saying, ""I have no money!"").

She received the cold shoulder from most, until one of the Starbucks crew members approached her and politely asked her to leave as her behavior was unacceptable and bothering other customers.

Of course, this lady rejected the idea that she was doing anything wrong, as they always do. She portrayed her behavior as perfectly normal... and then told the barista that she wasn't a billionaire, or anything. The Starbucks employee retreated to the other side of the store, unsure of how to act. I approached the employee and informed her of my being a paramedic, and asked her if she would like me to call the police. She knew I was a regular and expressed that she felt placed in an awkward position with recent events. I told her that I understood her stance, and that if she continued to bother other customers, I would contact the police myself and report the individual, or confront her if the behavior continued until the police arrived.

First and foremost, this individual was exhibiting behavior associated with mental illness &/or emotional disturbance. She is **deserving** of a law enforcement and emergency medical services response. Not to arrest her, punish her, or trespass her, but to care for her and make sure she is safe and others are safe around her.

She ended up departing on her own volition within 5 minutes or so after realizing that her behavior would result in unwanted attention.

In an event like this, when speaking to the 911 dispatcher, it's important to inform them that the individual is not being overtly threatening or violent, but is exhibiting signs of mental illness. Describe what the individual is doing. They'll also send an ambulance crew with the police, and the most likely outcome is the individual will be taken to the hospital, and not jail.

"##**Changes in response to the new Reddit UA**

Before you start reading this chapter, I just want to comment again on the [changes to the Reddit User Agreement](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/8mbchn/reddits_new_user_agreement/) which will come into effect on June 8th.

Because the changes to the UA will involve ""irrevocably waiv[ing] any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to [my] Content,"" I will be removing all chapters of the Deathworlders from Reddit itself, to be replaced with a simple introduction thread with a link to the Deathworlders website, muchh like you are reading now.

From now on, these posts will no longer include a ""previously on..."" snippet from the previous month's chapter. 

Thank you to everybody who brought this matter to my attention and gave me advice on how best to respond

## IF YOU ARE NEW TO THIS SERIES...
 
First of all, welcome! The Deathworlders has been in production now for more than three years, and is now ~~more than a million words~~ very, very long indeed!
 
While I hope that the story stands well enough on its own, the setting (Also known as ‚ÄúThe JVerse‚Äù) has often been a collaborative effort, building on the talented work of other writers who have breathed life and detail into its every corner.
 
Characters, species and concepts have entered this narrative thanks to those other writers, and while I have made every effort to keep the story coherent and readable without requiring you to read those other works‚Ä¶
 
‚Ä¶Read them. Seriously. Not only are they awesome, but you will gain a much richer understanding of the events unfolding in this story.
 
In particular, you will want to read:
 
* ‚ÄúHumans Don‚Äôt Make Good Pets‚Äù by /u/guidosbestfriend    
* ‚ÄúSalvage‚Äù by /u/Rantarian    
* ‚ÄúThe Xi√π Chang Saga‚Äù by /u/hume_reddit    
* ‚ÄúGood Training‚Äù by /u/ctwelve
* and ""The Waters of Babylon"" by /u/slice_of_pi
 
They are best read in the [Offical Reading Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/universes/jenkinsverse/chronological_reading_order) curated by /u/galrock0 and /u/fourbags or, if you prefer the abridged version which contains only those items most useful to understanding The Deathworlders, you can instead follow the [Essential Reading Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/universes/jenkinsverse/essential_reading_order)

##THE STORY SO FAR
 
***Beware Spoilers***
 
In the standard classification system used by those interstellar civilizations which are members of the Interspecies Dominion, a habitability rating of 10 or higher indicates that a planet is a so-called ‚Äúdeathworld‚Äù---lethally inimical to most forms of life, and populated by the strongest, toughest, fastest and deadliest forms of life in the galaxy.
 
For most of their history, the native sophonts of the planet Earth were unaware of their own planet‚Äôs habitability rating: A high-end twelve.
 
This fact only became known to humanity after a force of the feared and reviled entities known as ‚ÄúHunters‚Äù attempted to raid Earth to take slaves for their meat. In the aftermath of the attack, the Rogers Arena in Vancouver was closed for a month while alien blood was meticulously cleaned off the ice and taken away for study. 
 
The Interspecies Dominion responded by quarantining Sol and all its planets behind an impenetrable forcefield.
 
In the thirteen years since this historic event, Mankind have slipped their cage and begun their tortuous journey toward becoming an interstellar power. The colony of Cimbrean represents humanity‚Äôs first strong foothold in a hostile galaxy, protected by a stolen duplicate of the same forcefield that quarantines Earth. 
 
There have been ups and downs: A young Canadian woman, abducted by the grey-skinned ‚ÄúCorti‚Äù as a zoological research specimen, instead rescued and was befriended by a contingent of colonists from a mammalian species known as the Gao, and from this solid start a firm friendship has flourished between the two species.
 
But the galaxy is a corrupt place, ruled for countless millennia by the agents of a species known as the Igraens. This ‚ÄúHierarchy‚Äù has one overarching mission above all others---to suppress the evolution of sapient deathworld life-forms. To that end, they have rendered untold thousands of species extinct, and their efforts at containing the situation on Earth have led to the destruction of the city of San Diego.
 
But in that act, they reached too far. It is now impossible for those alien leaders who are not already under their influence to ignore the signs that something sinister is at work. The Humans and Gaoians have formed an elite force---the SOR, comprised of the hardy JETS and the pinnacle HEAT---whose spaceborne capability are unmatched by anyone, anywhere.
 
Mankind have barely set foot on the galactic stage before finding themselves embroiled in a deadly fight for survival...but when it comes to survival, there is nothing in the galaxy that matches a Deathworlder.

"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8lskol/satan_offered_me_a_job_i_took_it/)

‚ÄúWhat in God‚Äôs name is going on here?‚Äù I sputtered out.

Satan arched one of his thin black eyebrows.

‚ÄúIn *whose* name?‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI just meant\-‚Äù I began, before Satan cut me off with good\-natured laughter.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm only joking,‚Äù Satan said. ‚ÄúBut boy do you ever not know how to read a room, Jerry. You‚Äôre gonna have to work on that if you‚Äôre going to succeed down here in Hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut my name‚Äôs David,‚Äù I said.

Satan opened a manila file\-folder on his desk and slipped on a pair of pince\-nez reading spectacles. He scanned the folder for a moment before looking back up at me.

‚ÄúAre you not Jerry Smith, Satanic cult leader and Master of Unholy Magic?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúUh, no I‚Äôm an accountant,‚Äù I replied.

Satan scratched at his goatee.

‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs not good at all,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDo you at least have a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Unholy Magic?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIs that even a thing that exists?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course it is,‚Äù said Satan. ‚ÄúWe have an online program at the University of Phoenix.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut isn‚Äôt that place kind of a...‚Äù

‚ÄúA scam?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhy? Because they lure naive young people in with the promise of a better future and then bilk them out of thousands of dollars all in exchange for a degree not worth the paper it‚Äôs printed on?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, yeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat was the reason I was thinking of.‚Äù

‚ÄúJerry, Jerry, Jerry,‚Äù said Satan, shaking his head.

‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs actually\-‚Äù

‚ÄúI know that to the less enlightened that may seem like a scam,‚Äù he went on, ‚Äúbut here in Hell we call that a masterclass in practical business ethics. Plus due to some clever legal maneuvering, we have the implicit right to employ 20&#37; of their graduates after death.‚Äù

‚ÄúI uh... okay then.‚Äù

Satan sighed and closed the folder before slipping off his spectacles and setting them down gently on the desk.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI can tell that you‚Äôre probably not going to be a good fit here, but seeing that you‚Äôve already signed the contract and there are some pretty steep penalties for breach, you‚Äôre just going to have to do your best.‚Äù

He redirected his attention to the corner of the room where Paul and Stephen stood, still sporting their manic Cheshire cat grins.

‚ÄúAnd as for you two,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúchange out of those human suits. You‚Äôre giving me the creeps.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes sir, right away,‚Äù said Paul.

There was a wet tearing noise and Paul and Stephen‚Äôs faces split down the middle as two gargantuan, insect\-like heads sprouted out from their necks. The rest of the skin slid off onto the floor like a pile of discarded clothes.

Satan shook his head as he regarded the two now stark naked demons standing in his office.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you guys wear clothes under those suits?‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúSorry, Mr. Satan sir,‚Äù said Paul. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really hot with clothes on underneath.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou do realize that we‚Äôre currently in Hell, right?‚Äù said Satan. ‚ÄúYou guys should be used to the heat by now.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Mr. Satan, sir,‚Äù said Paul.

Satan sighed and pressed a little red button on his phone handset.

‚ÄúTina?‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYes, Mr. Satan?‚Äù came a tired\-sounding female voice.

‚ÄúCan you please send in Fyrznal to escort Acolytes Paul and Stephen to the Pain Monster down in HR?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Mr. Satan.‚Äù

The door the the office opened and a giant\-blue skinned demon with a hatchet embedded in the back of his skull entered. He slung the two acolytes over his shoulder and carried them screaming out of the office.

‚ÄúI should have fired those two a long time ago,‚Äù said Satan, shaking his head. ‚ÄúBut they‚Äôre my wife‚Äôs nephews\-\-what can I do?‚Äù

‚ÄúI uh... don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I replied.

As Satan skimmed the manila file\-folder on his desk, I eyed the two suits of human skin in the corner of the office, wondering if they had used to be filled with humans instead of demons. My thoughts were soon interrupted by Satan clearing his throat.

‚ÄúWell no since in wasting time,‚Äù he said ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get down to brass tacks. I assume you‚Äôre familiar with Orznak‚Äôs Law of Eternal Soul Entropy and Hyperinflation.‚Äù

‚ÄúOrznak‚Äôs *what*?‚Äù I asked.

Satan sighed and scribbled a note in the folder..

‚ÄúWell at the very least you should be acquainted with Baal‚Äôs Index of Human Evil and the correct way to measure a soul‚Äôs value in microHitlers,‚Äù he said.

I shook my head.

‚ÄúSorry, no,‚Äù I said.

Satan frowned and scribbled another note inside the folder. Then he shut it and tossed it into the fireplace in the back corner of the office. The fire flashed bright purple for a moment, and then the file was gone.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs alright,‚Äù he said with an easy smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all relatively straightforward; I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll pick it up in no time. In the mean time though I‚Äôm going to assign you a training officer to help you learn the ropes and monitor your progress.‚Äù

Satan pressed a button on his phone headset.

‚ÄúTina?‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYes, Mr. Satan?‚Äù a tired sounding female voice replied.

‚ÄúCan you send in Franken Teddy?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Mr. Satan,‚Äù replied the voice.

Satan released the button, and a moment later the office door burst off the hinges and an enormous demonic teddy bear lumbered into the office. His fur was gray and spotted with what looked suspiciously like old blood stains, and one of his eyes glowed red like burning coal. When he spoke, it was in a deep, resounding baritone that was so loud that it chattered my teeth.

‚ÄúYES, LORD SATAN?‚Äù he boomed.

‚ÄúHello, Franken Teddy,‚Äù said Satan. ‚ÄúThis here is Jerry Smith, Master of Satanic Accounting. I need you to show him the ropes on the new project they‚Äôre running out of Darryl‚Äôs department. Do you think you can do that for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI SHALL COMPLETE MY TASK OR DIE IN THE COURSE OF ITS GLORIOUS UNDERTAKING,‚Äù Franken Teddy said. Then, turning his attention to me, he said: ‚ÄúCOME HUMAN. WE HAVE WORK TO DO.‚Äù

Yet when I tried to stand, I found my legs to be strangely uncooperative. My stomach was squirming, and the demon‚Äôs ember eye felt like it was burning a hole in me from across the room.

‚ÄúUh, Satan?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYes, Jerry?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt uh... have any uh... *human* training officers do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy, are you some kind of racist or something?‚Äù said Satan.

‚ÄúNo, I just\-\-I mean, are teddy bears even technically a race?‚Äù

‚ÄúI AM A COMMANDER IN SATAN‚ÄôS DEMONIC LEGION,‚Äù boomed Franken Teddy. ‚ÄúNOT A TEDDY BEAR.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally insensitive, Jerry,‚Äù said Satan, shaking his head. ‚ÄúBesides, you‚Äôve got no need to worry. Franken Teddy is one of our finest training officers. And he‚Äôs only authorized to use lethal force in extreme circumstances.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs... comforting.‚Äù

‚ÄúCOME, TINY HUMAN,‚Äù boomed Franken Teddy.

He motioned for me to follow him out of the office and I did so. When we got into the hallway he said,

‚ÄúIT IS TIME FOR YOUR FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT LESSON, HUMAN. IN THE EVERLASTING KINGDOM OF HELL, ALL CIRCUMSTANCES QUALIFY AS EXTREME.‚Äù

I felt my knees weaken a little. I opened my mouth to reply, but all that came out was a slight gasping sound.

The hallway that Franken Teddy and I walked along was filled with closed doors; screams emanating from the rooms behind them. I felt a deep sense of dread beginning to bubble in my stomach.

I hope that I‚Äôm still alive in a few days time, and if I am, I‚Äôll update you then.

We all know that other companies putting our designs that are similar to Apple‚Äôs is nothing new, but this is one of the most blatant ripoffs of one of Apple‚Äôs designs by a somewhat reputable company I‚Äôve ever seen. 

Surely Apple will have to go after them for this. If it were only a similar design, I could see there being a potential case for defending Xiaomi. But not only is the design more than similar (it‚Äôs almost identical, down to the camera housing and notch), the marketing style and color scheme are nearly exactly the same as well.

These companies can‚Äôt get away with this. I hope Apple takes action. 

edit: I‚Äôll add that even the software was copied. Battery, WiFi, and Signal icons are all in the exact same location and look nearly identical, as well as the time on the lock screen. The writing in the top left, if it is displaying the carrier name, is a copy as well. Wow.

"This has been a long time coming. I am stepping away as mod and distancing myself from Reddit. There are several reasons why, particularly the current state of Reddit.

I am leaving Reddit because I do not have faith in the website's administrators to uphold their own guidelines. The_Donald is a safe space for racists, xenophobes, bigots, Russian trolls, fake news, and general hatred. It's not just T_D, though. There are pockets of hate subs that Reddit admins know about, but don't act on.

As time goes on, we learn more and more about the role Reddit's infrastructure played in influencing American politics. What has Reddit done? Banned a handful of Russian troll/bot accounts. Some have suggested Reddit is working with the FBI behind the scenes, and that's why they don't do more. Maybe. But what have Reddit admins ever done to suggest we should give them the benefit of the doubt? 2018 elections are already happening, and we must take action to protect the integrity of our democracy. Reddit has a responsibility as an American organization.

Finally, I take issue with the redesign. I think it is unethical for the admins to disguise advertisements (""promoted posts"") as authentic posts from real, contributing users. They seem to have no guidelines for advertisers, so we see ads pretending to be posts on TIL, AMA, TIFU, etc. Remember that Reddit admins don't do anything except make the platform. We are the content creators and the managers of communities. They exploit our contributions and disrupt our community.

Those are all my personal opinions, of course. I expect some will disagree. And that's fine. I'm not making any changes to the sub, so it doesn't really matter.

I really enjoyed this sub. I believe teachers need to look out for one another. For teachers in toxic schools, this sub is a refuge. For teachers with no experience or mentors, this sub is a place to find some guidance. Hopefully the community stays strong in the years to come.

You guys are great! Thank you for the community.",74,1527803506.0,8nikh4,354,"Adieu, Reddit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/8nikh4/adieu_reddit/,2018-05-31 17:51:46

"I read this sub a lot, and I‚Äôve posted a few times before because scary shit just happens to me for some reason. Now I‚Äôm hyper aware of my surroundings and I always carry a knife. This happened last night as i got off work. 

I live in a fairly large city which overall is pretty safe compared to other places I‚Äôve lived. There is a lot of homelessness here but they‚Äôre just people too, and if you respect them they don‚Äôt bother you at all. My neighborhood is next to the heart of downtown and pretty quiet and safe considering. 

I‚Äôm a waitress and I had gotten off work around 1 and we all fucked around for a bit after chatting and the such so I didn‚Äôt get home until 1:40 am. As stated before I‚Äôm pretty cautious so I park my car where I can see the intersection of my street. There‚Äôs no one out, not a soul, and I can see for all directions for 4 blocks. 

I got an eerie feeling as soon as a stepped out of my car. I was holding my two bags walking in the middle of the street just a few feet away from the access controlled front door or my building when I heard something. 

This dude who had to have ducked out from somewhere was barreling towards me full speed, he had this look on him face like her was fucked all the way up on something, I‚Äôd dealt with drunk ppl all night and his body language was just off. I could tell he wasn‚Äôt homeless based on his clothes, he wasn‚Äôt dressed super nice but his stuff was new. 

I‚Äôm not one to panic when I‚Äôm sober, I‚Äôm wearing my huge work clogs which I forgot to change out of and I know that if he gets close enough to me to try and grab me I‚Äôm going to kick him in the shin as hard as I can. I don‚Äôt turn to face him but I can see him staring at me while trying to close the gab between us from the corner of my eye. I calmly smile my work smile as I slide my knife from my bag, open it slightly, and with one smooth but violent motion I very loudly click it into place so it‚Äôs locked at open. 

I know he saw and heard me because he immediately turned around and went in the other direction even though he was in the middle of the street. I punched in our building code and went inside after making sure the door shut behind me. 

I‚Äôm not sure what that dudes intentions were, he was probably some poor drunk or high idiot but I can say with 100% certainty that he definitely didn‚Äôt want to meet an equally creepy small girl smiling while pulling a knife out.

"Hi ladies! I'm 26/f. This is not a huge issue for me but just something I wonder about occasionally. I used to be really self conscious in high school and it's taken me A LOT of therapy and working on myself to get to where I am now, i.e. pretty happy with myself. I still have moments when I feel really self conscious though. For example I was working out with some friends today and a guy friend told me ""your face is really red"". Umm.. ok? I have really fair skin, we were exercising and it was hot so my face is bound to turn red. Why do people feel the need to point it out though?!?! Do they get pleasure out of drawing attention to someone else's embarrassment? Like, I *know* my face is red, I can feel it, why the fuck do you need to say it out loud, I can't make it go away!? I think it's just really rude and immediately makes me feel inferior and ugly and it takes me a while to get over it..

"Here on TRP, we like to talk a lot about the ‚ÄúAlpha Fucks‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúBeta Bucks‚Äù mentality that separates men from one another in the dating world. But why do we have this dichotomy? The answer might be simpler than you think. In fact, it boils down to one simple question: How much are you giving them? 

To illustrate this point, there are two friends of mine who perfectly demonstrate how this one question separates the ‚ÄúAlpha Fucks‚Äù from the ""Beta Bucks‚Äù. We will call them Guy #1 and Guy #2 

Guy #1 is unemployed, on probation, has no car and sleeps on the floor of his friend‚Äôs apartment. His prospects for a brighter future are close to nonexistent, with his best case scenario being that he does not end up in prison.  

Guy #2 has a stable white collar job, plenty of potential for upward mobility at work, a strong moral code, all kinds of talents and is incredibly dependable in almost any situation. 

Both of them hit the gym regularly, are both considered attractive by mainstream society, and yet at the end of the day one does significantly better than the other with women (hint: it‚Äôs not the one who logically speaking should be doing better). Why is that? 

That‚Äôs where the question of ‚Äúhow much are you giving them?‚Äù comes in.

Guy #1 recently met a girl who said she thought he was really attractive, but that she had a boyfriend who was dying of cancer. He didn‚Äôt really say anything about it, and blew her off. She kept sending him aggressively flirty texts, and inviting him to do things. Every once in a while he would agree to spend maybe 5 minutes of his time with her. When he would, he would say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested in you, you have a boyfriend.‚Äù He gave the bare minimum investment of his time and spent no money on her. 

Eventually, it got to the point where she broke down. She told him that her boyfriend wasn‚Äôt actually dying of cancer, that he might be gay and that she would ditch him in a heartbeat for guy #1. The two of them did it in a nearby forest, and he then said he had no interest in being in a relationship with her because she was a slut. Once a cheater, always a cheater. She was flustered beyond belief, but was so attracted to him that she kept inviting him to do stuff. 

One day, she asked him for drinks. He told her ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt drive and I have $10 left in my bank account, I can‚Äôt afford it.‚Äù To which she replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pick you up and pay for your drinks .‚Äù She did, then proceeded to spend $110 on drinks USING HER BOYFRIEND‚ÄôS CREDIT CARD. 

Her Beta provider boyfriend was LITERALLY providing her money to use on another man. 

Side note: if my girlfriend EVER had a charge on my credit card for $110, I would drop her ass immediately. Why he even gave her his credit card is beyond me. But that‚Äôs a different analysis for a different day. 

This dynamic with Guy #1 and this girl continues to this day, and what has he given her throughout the course of this? Jack. Fucking. Shit. Yet, she keeps coming back to him for more, and gives him more of her time and boyfriend‚Äôs money to him. She is literally Hooked on A Feeling. 

Guy #2 met a girl a little while back who was single and found him to be very attractive. At first, he wasn‚Äôt very invested in it, she was blowing up his phone, and they were sleeping together regularly. She even told him at one point ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just be friends‚Äù. He ignored her, she started blowing up his phone again and they were sleeping together again. 

But after spending a bit more time with her, he told me he really liked her and wanted to be in a relationship with her, despite there being potential that she could be leaving the country in a certain period of time. 

Nevertheless, he persisted as if they were going to start dating. He would pay for her meals, her drinks, and more. He would compliment her, say really nice/sweet things, and gave her all kinds of time and money. He would bail on plans to go to the gym with me just because she wanted to grab dinner around the time we were supposed to be lifting. One night, he left the bar we were at instantly because she called him. 

Everything that mainstream culture says guys should do for women, he did those things. 

How did that turn out?

Well, within roughly a month (maybe less), she started to pull away and eventually gave guy #2 the official ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just be friends‚Äù talk.  That was it for this dynamic. 

These two examples stick out to me, but I also see this happen all of the time in my life. Girls who I ignore/give very little time to will do anything to get my attention. The ones I lend a lot of my time to ditch me at the drop of a hat. 

Which leads me to my overarching point:

"...with cheese. A whole 760 calories worth of fatty, messy, ""junk"". But this isn't a post of shame, rather it's a post about moderation and enjoying the guilty pleasures once in a while. 

Most of the time I eat pretty healthy. The vast majority of the time I eat to my set caloric goal per day, and meet my macros and so I find that sometimes I build up a sense that some foods are ""out of bounds"" because they're calorie bombs. I think that's a bit dangerous and causes us to binge on occasion when that feeling of ""can't have this"" becomes overpowering. So instead, I believe that nothing should be off\-limits. If I feel like pizza, some wings or a Whopper once in a while I go for it\- BUT I plan ahead. I plug it into MFP ahead of time and work the rest of my meals around it for the day so as to still meet my goals. Which is what I did yesterday, and you know what? I was actually down on the scale this morning despite my fears that somehow the Whopper would defy CICO and push me up a bit.

So my message here is definitely be consistent in meeting your daily goals, changing your lifestyle and reaping the rewards but don't be afraid to enjoy life's guilty pleasures from time to time. The choices your make on how and what you eat every day are your choices. Choose to make the better ones to reach your goals with general consistency but definitely, live life on your terms.

"The local joint I work in is open 365 days a year.  Working X\-mas and Thanksgiving can suck, but we all try to get through it together by bringing treats to eat and gifts for each other etc, and staggering shifts so no one has to work more than 4 hours or so. 

One of \*my\* traditions to make working Thanksgiving more bearable is to seek out someone who is dining alone and secretly buy their meal.  Sadly, it's not hard to find someone who is alone, but it brightens my day to hopefully brighten theirs. 

One year, I noticed an older gentleman sitting alone in the new girls' \(K.\) section and I asked if he'd paid his bill yet, and he hadn't so I asked her to give it to me and tell him that someone had anonymously bought his meal and wanted to wish him a Happy Thanksgiving.  Turned out to be a $23 tab, and I gave her $30 to cover the meal and her tip.  

When she told him about it, he was overwhelmed.  His wife had passed away the previous year and this was his first Thanksgiving alone.  He was so grateful that he paid it forward and bought the meal for a family sitting near him, and then left K. a $100. tip.  Which she joyfully bragged about, and pocketed as though she had made it happen for herself.  Not one word to me of thanks, or even an offer to return the money I had given her for a tip.  A couple of my other co\-workers had seen this go down, and we all were looking at each other like ""is this chick for real?"".  I mean, I didn't want anything out of the transaction other than to brighten the day of a person who may have been lonely, but dang, girl, get a clue!!

"We need to raise all hell to get samsung to fix this. I've contacted news outlets, filed BBB complaints, along with my state attorney general, and so far samsung's responses have been a big ""f you""

On every smart television they manufacture, there are adverts displayed in the main UI of the TV's interface. This is not configurable, this is not something users can turn off or opt-out of, this is a permanent ""feature"" of the tv. 

A massive count of users have taken to the samsung forums, reddit, social media, and other platforms to express their concern over having no control of their hardware. The adverts are distracting, mess up how you use the TV by creating inconsistent UI, sometimes inappropriate for younger family members, and provide us absolutely no benefit. Samsung has responded to users by stating they would push an update out to fix this. This claim has been made by Samsung's twitter responses to social media complaints, and the mega thread on samsung's forum regarding this lack of control over adverts displaying. Samsung had also claimed the ads were not coming from their platform, but in fact they were coming from applications that were installed. Users attempted to unisntall every application, but you are not allowed to uninstall all of them. In addition, users are also getting ads for brand new Samsung TVs, myself I've gotten an ad for a new OLED samsung TV, on my brand new $3,000 Samsung Frame TV. It's been more than a year since these claims by samsung to fix it were made, and we are still stuck with nothing. Users have found workarounds to prevent the ads, however samsung has pushed firmware updates that made the ads come back.

I filed a complaint with the BBB, gave them all the details, and was shortly after contacted by a Samsung representative at the ""Office of the President"", Amber H. She stated that the terms I agreed to when setting up the TV allow Samsung to do whatever the hell they want on my TV. This was an interesting point since I explicitly did NOT agree to any terms when setting up my TV. I refused any terms, and wanted to use the TV as a dumb input device. Even then, I still got ads in the main UI. Amber told me despite what every user wished for, they would not make fixes to the products. I adamantly expressed dissatisfaction with the product, the negative impact the ads had, and the lack of control over the hardware I rightfully owned, and she told us we agreed to this. I saw nowhere in any of Samsung's product listings that you were opted-in to ads on your TV, and you had no way to disable them. This was an undisclosed ""feature."" After Amber and I going back and forth, the BBB complaint was unsatisfactorily closed. I was not done, so I contacted my state attorney general to escalate this. I notified Amber that I forwarded our conversation to my attorney general, and she condescendingly advised me that nothing would change. 

Samsung has made empty promises, directly lied, and misrepresents the products they sell. Then they refuse to make you happy after you've made your purchase, and continue to cash in on the ads they serve on their smart TV platform. Why the hell do they need more cash when my TV was $3

Samsung needs to be corrected and fix their products before the precedence is set that users get no control over their hardware and are force fed ads.

"Every time I visit this sub I see like every 3rd or 4th post complaining about something isn't technically related. To be clear, log in issues, stuck in loading screens, and similar issues should be fixed and aren't what I'm talking about.

More specifically are the posts saying ""x"" monster is too hard, gear is too hard to get, cells to expensive to remove, dodging is too hard, the list goes on. What really surprises me is how balanced and rewarding the game is compared to it's relative challenge.

Posts like ""I can't full combo bosses because they hit too fast"" are just plain silly. This game is risk vs. reward. You wanna do more damage then you have to decide how risky you're going to be. Those long axe combos require very careful positioning and timing. Honestly, I interpret this comment as ""I don't like this game mechanically,"" which on the surface to me seems like why the game is fun. It focuses on skill execution, timing, and pattern recognition, not too much else other than that. 

Dodging falls into the same category. Once you learn a behemoths move set, dodging becomes relatively easy (chainblades are a bit more difficult). And, aside from a few poor tells from move sets, most behemoths telegraph their moves very well in advance. There were plenty of fights I had to play like monkey a few times before I understood what I needed to do and learn their patterns.

Getting gear is really easy too, I'm honestly surprised. If you're farming a behemoth for loot, then on average you're probably upgrading around 1 piece of gear every fight or at least every other fight. Last night I finished the fully upgraded level 10 shockjaw armor and level 10 ragetail sword. Sure, I had to farm out these bosses a few times to get there, but I figured I'd have to if I wanted to lvl 10 every piece of an armor/weapon of that behemoth. 

I can't sing the praises of Dauntless enough. I feel like the game is challenging with a healthy level of difficultly. Last night I downed Rezakiri for the first time with my friend as a duo, and it felt so awesome. I had to try him at least 4 times before actually being able to finish the fight. The first time I fought him with level 7 firebrand gear and a level 7 ragetail sword was too difficult for me. That was a great feeling. It gave me a goal to work towards before I could finish him.

I honestly think most people with a enough time could easily learn/farm out the behemoths necessary to progress. So please, dearest reddit community, enjoy the free game and be happy that they created a game that requires more than 10-20 hours of playtime to finish.",137,1527821754.0,8nl15t,120,"Holy Moly, the complaining is real.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dauntless/comments/8nl15t/holy_moly_the_complaining_is_real/,2018-05-31 22:55:54

"I usually frequent JUSTNOMIL. But this post..it fits better here. 

Fuck. Oh my god. So. 

The fiance and I did break up. It was very, very civil. Understanding. It was for his health. And for his life path. And we were just going different directions. He understood it. So did I. We cried together. We cried some more. And the evening progressed. 

And in the span it took him to tell his parents and walk back to his room. Hell broke free and cascade itself among all that is holy! 

Every one of them, save for the fianc√©, unfriended me on any social media platform. Then. THEN. His parents go and tell EVERYONE about how I put so much hurt on him that theyre in ""damage control"" mode. And how I need to pack his things so they can come get them. 

First of all. This is my goddamn house. You aint about to tell me to do shit.
Secondly. You aint about to INVITE yourself to come get SOMEONE ELSES possessions. I dont give a fuck who you are. 
Thirdly. This is still my former fiances home. HE may come get his belongings so that HE and I may part in person. We invested 3 years. We separated mutually. We want our closure. 

""I dont want to run the risk of him seeing you. Youre not going to insult my intelligence and hurt him anymore than you already have.""

AND THEY HAVE THE FUCKING AUDACITY TO WONDER WHY HE DOESNT FUCKING OPEN UP TO THEM. THIS IS WHY. THEY. DONT. LISTEN. TO. SHIT.

So. I called former fiance. Explained what was going on. Told him I didnt argue back with his father. Only that I am not relinquishing his personal property without him here to see its all there. I have my reasons. For instance, if something goes missing, guess who that falls back on? 

Lastly. And certainly not least. Dont you EVER think youre more superior than me. Or anyone else. You're not God. Yourr a fucking toxin. A poison. A CUNT. Seriously. Fuck his family. 

I will forever love my former fiance. I wish him the very best in his life and all that life can offer him. Hes an absolutely wonderful man, and when he gets better, I know he will do wonderful things.

I got out at my house and he hopped out with me and we ran into the house to check on my wife. A heavy section of furniture had fallen and broken her foot and my son was stuck upstairs (child gate) and she had passed out multiple times.

"Let me begin by saying that this is partially my story partially my friends. But, I think you guys will enjoy it

So I have a friend we will name her Mary. Mary was with a guy who will refer to as Douche Nozzle (DN). Mary and DN were happily living together when DN cheats. Mary decides to give DN another chance. 6 months later DN does what cheaters do and cheats. So wisely Mary leaves and gets another apartment. 

Now, when Mary DN lived together both their names were on the lease to their mutual apartment. But DN qualified for the apt on their own so Mary asks that the two of them do the paperwork to get her off the lease. DN asks if Mary will wait until he has a new roommate since this will make it easier on him. Mary agrees

Three months later Mary says something to the effect of ""hey I want my name off the lease its been three months I am not waiting any more."" DN basically tells Mary to go kick rocks. When Mary tells me this I ask a few questions
1) do you still have a key
2) are you on the lease as a resident or a cosigner
The answers are
1) no
2) yes, a resident

So being the nice friend that I am I tell her she should go to the office and get another key. Then we should host a party at the old apartment. There is nothing DN can do since Mary is technically on the lease. Mary warns DN that she will take action if he does not get her off the lease.

DN decided to ignore her.  Imagine DN's face when we show up with about 15 of our friends and a ton of alcohol to party. Needless to say DN threatens to call the cops but I mention that since technically Mary is on the lease as a resident that she is well within her rights to have people over. DN calls the cops. The cops come and Mary explains that she is a resident and listed as such on the lease agreement. Cops ask DN about this he reluctantly confirms that it is true. Now we are not monsters we didn't get super rambunctious or destructive we just stayed up until about 1 am playing cards against humanity then we all went home while DN sat sulking in his room.

The very next day Mary gets a call from the apartment asking her to come sign the lease release form. Mission Accomplished.

"I noticed in another thread that lots of people are buying organic produce. Organic produce is generally more expensive than conventional produce.

The majority of the public believes that organic farming does not use pesticides, however this is not true. Organic farming does not use *synthetic* pesticides (with a few exceptions) but instead uses naturally derived pesticides. Naturally derived pesticides are not by definition any better for your health than synthetic, because whether something is natural has no bearing on whether it is healthful or good. (Don't believe me? Try eating a random mushroom in the forest.) To assume that natural is better is the [appeal to nature fallacy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature) A great example: copper sulfate and rotenone/pyrethrin mixture are pesticides approved for organic farming that are more toxic than many synthetic pesticides.

Studies that find fewer pesticide residues on organic produce are essentially rigged - they are only testing for the synthetic pesticides, giving a free pass to the naturally derived ones.

The current scientific consensus (i.e. the consensus of scientific observation and experiment) shows no health benefit to eating organic produce. Sure, you can probably find a single study that says otherwise (you can find a single study to support almost any opinion) however it is the consensus of large amounts of high quality scientific evidence that is important.

Another reason people buy organic is to avoid GMO's, even though the leading [scientific organizations](http://www.siquierotransgenicos.cl/2015/06/13/more-than-240-organizations-and-scientific-institutions-support-the-safety-of-gm-crops/) in the world have concluded, based on over 3,000 scientific studies, that GMO's are completely safe for humans to eat.

Here is some more material if you want to read more. Some of these are blog posts because those are more accessible for a layperson, but the blogs do reference scientific studies if you want to read those.

TLDR: Buy whatever produce is cheaper, whether organic or not.

***
Adrenaline threw Clint‚Äôs mind into focus. He looked from the corpse in the doorway to Malina standing over it, to Florence bolting for the open door of the sitting room. And then he understood why: this room was a dead end. If they were all caught in here, they‚Äôd be helpless as drowned rats. Clint nodded back at Boots and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll guard him.‚Äù

Malina hesitated there. Looked like she wanted to argue. But there was no time. She and Florence bounded down the hall.

‚ÄúYou run,‚Äù the bleeding man murmured, his voice watery and wandering. ‚ÄúI will be fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not leaving you here, Boots.‚Äù Clint helped him stand up from his chair and helped him settle against the same wall as the fireplace, so that anyone who came looking would have to stick their head inside to look around‚Äîand he could, hypothetically, obliterate them.

He and Boots crouched down there beside each other against the cold stone wall. Clint sat between Boots and the wall and tried not to think about another bullet rending through his flesh. He held Malina‚Äôs shotgun tightly in both hands and checked it once, twice, to make sure that both shells were loaded. He threw his backpack onto the floor in front of him and scrounged all the spare shells he could out of the front pouch. Jammed them into the pocket of his breeches. 

Then Clint crouched there, silent, waiting. Shotgun balanced on his knee. But even as he focused and tried to hold the gun steady, he could feel the aftermath of the concussion rattling his brain. When he trained his stare on one spot‚Äîthe black open maw of the doorway‚Äîthe room seemed to ebb and dip gently all around him. He didn‚Äôt realize his shotgun was wavering too until Boots whispered to him, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

And Clint just waved him off, pressed a stern finger to his lips.

The front door hinged open. Clint kept the muzzle of the gun trained more or less where he guessed a head might appear.

The people moving down the hall walked slowly, their steps velveted, like they were trying not to be heard. A buzzing murmuring rose up from them when they stepped over Erwulf‚Äôs corpse. Clint tried to guess at the number of people out there, but he couldn‚Äôt pluck the whispers apart well enough to begin to estimate. 

Someone out there hissed, ‚ÄúSeparate. Keep silent. Find them.‚Äù

Clint swallowed the thick bulge of terror in his throat. Hoped that Malina and Florence had found somewhere to hole themselves up. He cursed himself a dozen times over for not finding a different spot for himself and Boots, but he knew there was no time to heave Boots limping down the hall. They would have been caught out the moment they tried.

Someone grabbed his gun. The movement snapped Clint out of his thoughts so violently that he nearly turned the gun on whoever was trying to hold it. But he looked over and saw Boots there, nodding at Clint‚Äôs hands. 

‚ÄúYou keep shaking.‚Äù His whisper was soft enough to hide itself inside the crackle of the fire. ‚ÄúLet me.‚Äù

Clint nearly argued. But then the footsteps neared their door, and Boots simply wrenched the shotgun away from him without waiting for an answer. An indignant *hey* nearly burst out of Clint, but he pressed his fist over his mouth and shrunk backwards as Boots leaned over him and dug his elbow into Clint‚Äôs ribs for support. Inclining forward made Boots wince, but at the very least blood didn‚Äôt seem to seep his bandage. 

For half a second, someone appeared in the doorway. A woman holding a short-barreled rifle peered from the hallway just enough to try to see if anyone was inside.

It was just enough.

Boots did not hesitate. He snapped the shotgun instantly toward her skull and pulled the trigger. The *boom* was immense. Clint clamped both palms over his ears and could hear nothing but ringing‚Äînot the telling scramble of boots toward them or away. When he looked up, the shooter‚Äôs corpse had crumpled in the doorway, her head like half a burst watermelon. 

A fist struck his leg. 

‚ÄúGet more goddamn bullets,‚Äù he heard Boots say, as if from somewhere far away. It took Clint a moment to realize he was shouting. Wondered how many times he had said it before Clint noticed.

Someone laughed down the hallway, faint radio static beyond the roar of broken sound in Clint‚Äôs head. He heard Atlas‚Äôs distinctly chipper voice call, ‚ÄúThat sounds like my old friend Boots!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sound like you need to fuck off,‚Äù Boots growled back. He snapped open the shotgun, discarded the spent shell, and held out a hand without looking. When Clint slapped a new bullet into it, Boots reloaded the second chamber and clicked the gun back together in a single quick motion. 

Atlas paused and sighed, as if he was regarding his spent teammate in the doorway. ‚ÄúYou know, I forget what an excellent shot you are.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome closer and I will remind you.‚Äù Boots glared down the end of the shotgun, his whole body coiled and tensed.

Clint sat waiting, heart pounding in his throat. 

The fire roared beside them. But the hall stayed quiet. 

Finally Atlas emitted a low chuckle. His voice echoed up the hall like a phantom. ‚ÄúIs this the wrong time to ask you to come back to my team, bud?‚Äù

Clint‚Äôs fear was pasty in his mouth. He tried to stay calm, tried not to imagine what would happen if one of Atlas‚Äôs men rushed them. For half a second, he saw Boot‚Äôs shattered skull sitting in his lap, a wall of scarlet and brain matter covering his chest. But when he blinked Boots was still there, stiff as a rabbit that‚Äôs just realized it‚Äôs being hunted, listening. Waiting.

The army down the hall did not move.

Atlas sighed and said, ‚ÄúYou know, I really didn‚Äôt want to waste one of these.‚Äù

Boots‚Äôs eyes locked onto Clint‚Äôs in understanding and fear. Before Clint could ask what Atlas meant, something small and dark bounced off the wall, landed only a foot or two away. Before Clint could quite register what it was, Boots picked it up and lobbed it back at the doorway.

The grenade exploded in midair. The outward force of the burst flattened Clint back against the wall. Hundreds of little teeth bit into the flesh of his forearm as he raised his arm to cover his head. Boots‚Äôs scalp was peppered little flakes of scarlet, but he did not seem to notice. He pushed himself up onto his haunches and sat crouched, as if he intended to dart up and away the second he needed to.

Smoke bloomed in the room, thick and burning. Too thick to see through. Clint wheezed, realized with a terrible intensity that if they didn‚Äôt get out of there, soon, *now*, they were both going to choke on the rotten air. 

Another shooter appeared in the doorway. This one Boots only managed to strike in the shoulder before he fell back, crying out in shock and pain. Clint threw his arm around Boots‚Äôs shoulders and helped haul him to his feet.

‚ÄúWe have to go,‚Äù he hissed, and Boots buried his cough in his elbow, nodding in agreement. The smoke clouded the hallway, so thickly Clint couldn‚Äôt see more than a few inches in either direction. He gripped Boots tightly, mostly to make sure that the man wouldn‚Äôt collapse. And blindly, he dove right, deeper into the belly of the house. Bullets ricocheted off the walls ahead and behind them, just missing. One of them sailed by so close Clint could hear the air zipper open and shut around it, inches from his ear.

At the end of the hall, Malina‚Äôs face peered up from the stairwell. She beckoned them to follow her. 

Clint wanted to argue that there was no point going up another floor, that they were just making themselves get cornered more slowly, but there was no time for debate. No safety in raising his voice, now of all times. They pattered up the stairs together. Boots gasped, lungs heaving as they tried to clear the smoke out. He had slung the shotgun over one shoulder to ball up his sweater and hack into it, trying to muffle the sound.

Florence waited for them at the top of the stairs. She looked fierce and panicked, her dark eyes wider than Clint had ever seen them. Beckoned them into the room closest to the stairwell. It looked like it had once been servants‚Äô quarters. There were a trio of beds in here, three chests at their feet. The room reeked of copper, and Clint quickly saw why: there were bodies, piled in the corner, a blanket thrown over them.

Malina, Florence, and Boots barely paid them as much as glance.

‚ÄúI have three grenades,‚Äù Florence hissed. ‚ÄúWe have to trap them in the stairs.‚Äù

Boots held out a hand. ‚ÄúGive me one,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúNo fucking way.‚Äù

He scoffed. ‚ÄúWe both know who have better aim.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot when you‚Äôre suffering from blood loss.‚Äù Florence passed one of the three off to Malina, as if to prove her point.

Boots‚Äôs face went dark, near-volcanic, but he did not argue.

Clint could barely understand them. He had to reconstruct their words out of the little ends of sounds he could make out. He rubbed hard at his ear; his palm came away bloody. He muttered, ‚ÄúThis game is going to make me go fucking deaf.‚Äù

Malina frowned at Boots. ‚ÄúWhy do you have Clint‚Äôs gun?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause he hold it like this.‚Äù He waved the shotgun erratically at the door. ‚ÄúAnd I go, mmm, no, you will only shoot wall. So I take it.‚Äù

Clint had to stifle his laughter in his palm. Absurd, impossible humor, at a time like this. He said, ‚ÄúIt was not nearly that bad.‚Äù

But Boots didn‚Äôt smile. He pointed at the open doorway and held a finger to his lips. 

Clint strained to hear it, whisper-soft in the darkness: the tread of boots on stone. Rising up the steps. 

Florence edged to the doorway and peered out of it, grenade in hand, arm poised. Ready to lob it down the stairwell at any moment. 

But one of Atlas‚Äôs gang shouted at the others, ‚ÄúWait! Listen!‚Äù

And this time, Clint could hear it too. 

The bellowing gust of huge wings, beating. Loud as a storm, rattling the house as if it were made from matchsticks. 

The dragon riders had come at last.

"Not killing a developer in the traditional sense of them going out of business, but killing them in the sense of them never producing anything else you like because they hit it big on a game as a service, then stopped producing your favorite series.

I explained it to a friend who likes Godzilla as imagine the people who normally make Godzilla movies comes out with an amazing new movie, then they start releasing merch for the movie: shirts, trinket grab boxes, replicas, etc.  You think the merch is cool, but it's not really something you're interested in that much.  The problem is some people think the merch is *REALLY* cool.  The merch ends up making 10x more profit than the developing cost of the movie and they can make it really cheap.  You think that's cool, but you'd really like a new movie.  New movies usually come out every other year, but it's been 4 years and still no new movie, but there's new merch every other day that people love.  The developers of the movie then put out a quiet announcement saying they've mostly just been focusing all their efforts on their merch devision and it will be many years before we get a new Godzilla movie.

This is how I see games a service.  It happened almost 100% with GTA Online.  It took almost double (triple?) the normal development timeframe to go from GTA5 to the new Red Dead.  Now there have been developers who make games that I love that I just hope their next attempt at games as a service falls flat on their face.

Take Bioware for example.  They haven't had the best luck with getting a good game as a service out with their attempts at putting them into DAI and Mass Effect (I think ME got a game as a service component in the last game, but correct me if I'm wrong).  Now with Anthem coming out, I'm really hoping it fails and fails hard.  If it's successful, it can only mean they'll be focusing more on Anthem and less on games I love like Dragon Age.  Even then, if they implement a successful microtransaction service into the new Dragon Age (as they've said they're interested in doing), what's stopping them from going the GTA route and abandoning development of anything else to put in kitschy cosmetics for Dragon Age 4?",160,1527799186.0,8ni2y9,356,Am I wrong to think games as a service should fail because they're developer killers?,https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8ni2y9/am_i_wrong_to_think_games_as_a_service_should/,2018-05-31 16:39:46

"I posted about this previously and took it down, but here's more reporting on it.   As a citizen, I don't want my city giving contractors the OK to use bulk-data-collection methods for contracted law enforcement.   I want to know that ATLPlus can't just take and use the plate location data (of EVERY parked car in the city) to sell and from which to derive more information about me, even if I have no parking tickets.

Let's demand that their contract stipulate that the data be discarded after no violators are found, IF we even wish to allow bulk-scanning.

> From June 1 through June 15, late fees and penalties on all outstanding tickets issued before March of last year will be waived. 

> After that, the parking agency ATL Plus plans to use automatic license plate readers to check the status of parking meters and any possible outstanding vehicle citations. 

> If your car has fines of more than $100 and three or more outstanding parking tickets, the city says your car will be booted.

" 5e, so my dm and I found a little thing that completely changes how we look at skill checks. So first the basics:
(PHB)Tying a knot is listed as a sleight of hand roll, but  instead of your dex mod you use your int mod, and then in a little footnote it explains that you can change any ability check to use a different stat. So if you are doing an intimidation check but you are doing it by showing your strength you would use your str mod instead of your cha mod, this is also referenced in Xanathar's guide. This is an alternate rule set that the PHB has, it is not homebrew but its not the standard rules so you probably were unaware of this.  As a person who takes pride in my Role-play ability this makes it a lot easier for me to RP and be successful even if i don't have the stats for the normal check, it has greatly expandes the possibilities for how I approach situations.
What do you think of this and did you know about it, do you intend to use it?
EDIT: So the part about knot is in xanathar's in the part about tool proficiency, under knot tying, that where it refers to the phb about this alternative rule. Here are the pages i am referring to: Phb pages bottom right of page 174 and continued on the top left of page 175. Xanathar's guide page 161.

"Vader is hunting for Luke Skywalker, specifically \- the opening crawl says as much \- before the Emperor gets wind of the kid's name. Vader later tells us exactly why \- he wants Luke to join him. 

Problem is, Vader has to capture Luke alive without setting off too many alarm bells. So he's excited when he sees the pictures from Hoth and his Force connection to Luke starts pinging. He can't order a ground assault \- that's not standard procedure. Standard procedure is to just pounce on the area and bombard from space. 

Here's the thing \- they were looking right at a shield generator. Everyone on that bridge saw it. Why did Ozzel opt for the standard approach? Because he wanted an immediate naval blockade. He knew if it was some random group of pirates, they couldn't do anything. If it was the Rebels, crashing into position right over their base would interdict their ships. 

*Ozzel was right*. 

Vader knew what Ozzel was thinking. He was stoking the man's injured pride, trying to get him to do exactly that. Why? *Because he saw the shield generator.* He'd dealt with a thousand of those things during the Clone Wars. Ozzel missed it because he was a naval man, not a groundpounder. 

Vader knew what Ozzel would do. Vader knew why it would fail. Vader knew that once all that happened, he'd have an excuse to lead a ground assault \- and capture Luke alive. 

The ion cannon was the kind of miscalculation that even Sith Lords occasionally make.

So, Vader can't have Ozzel testifying or complaining. Better to just look terrifying. Hence the summary execution. And once you've done that, you've got to establish that as your MO. So Needa goes too.  

It's interesting, isn't it, that immediately after the failed attack on Hoth, the Emperor calls Vader up and says ""Hey, interesting tidbit \- the jerk who blew up our toy is your kid. You still on the team?"" Looking at that conversation with the above in mind, it's very obvious that Palpatine isn't informing Vader\- he's calling him out. No wonder Vader redoubles his efforts to capture Luke. \(I mean, he also knows that he's going to be trapped on the new Death Star with that nebbish Jerjerrod.\)

\(Someone is going to respond with some Legends argument about how Ozzel was known as a schmuck, but I'm telling you \- look at what the movie is showing you.

"#TL;DR  

Sandwich six US quarters together with thermal paste to make the heatsink.  Place it on top of the CPU with some more thermal paste.

#Methodology  

I modified a [general purpose Raspberry Pi benchmarking script](https://github.com/aikoncwd/rpi-benchmark) to only run the CPU test portion of `sysbench` in a loop.  I ran each configuration until the Pi reached its apparent thermal throttling temperature, around 81-82.7 degrees C.  Starting from that point I measured the running times.  

#Comments  

Modern US quarters are made of a layer of 75% copper/25% nickel [cupronickel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupronickel) and a core of pure copper, with a total nickel composition of 8.33%.  Not too bad for pocket change.  However, if you have older US coins or foreign coins, then they might be made of better heat-conducting materials like silver or pure copper.  

The thermal paste stabilizes the stack of quarters a little bit but it's not suitable for anything beyond sitting perfectly upright and gentle movements.  If you need to move or mount your Pi then you will need to look into ways of fastening the heatsink more securely.  

If you don't have thermal paste on hand then some people claim that toothpaste, peanut butter, and other household items can be used in a pinch.  But you didn't hear that from me...

"</shitty>

Gotta break from the shitty for an important announcement.

Normally we mods try to be light touch with this sub.  Most of the posts are shitty and we love you all for that, some are just shit and those we tolerate for the great shitty discussions that they generate.

Recently though, we had a complaint about a user specifically self-promoting and spamming.  I looked into it and it was borderline spam but more interestingly the complainer and the complainee were fighting about it.

First thought was just ban them both but we wanted to be shittier about our response.  We gave the users an option, either ban them both, or allow them to settle this dispute like the shitty coders they are.  Surprisingly, they both agreed instantly and now...I am happy to formally announce the first ever /r/shittyprogramming Deathmatch between /u/mr-gaiasoul and /u/FascinatedBox.

Two coders enter, two coders will leave, but ONE will be the shittiest and one will face a ban.

The event will be live streamed June 22 at 8PM EST on whichever service has the most liberal Code of Conduct.

Please realize this is for fun, but also we'd like some good to come of it, so we have set up a fundraiser to benefit Code.org @ [https://donate.code.org/shittyprogramming](https://donate.code.org/shittyprogramming).

Look for more updates to come and hopefully a fair amount of trash talk.  Appreciate you all and keep it shitty.

"So a while back, when everyone was uploading pictures of their Richard Christy signed headshots, I wanted one too as Richard is fucking hilarious.

I send him an email explaining that I'm a huge fan and would love a signed picture. Here's the thing: I'm in Ireland \- so I understand the shipping cost would be very expensive. I offered to pay the shipping if he sent me his PayPal details or something; quite frankly knowing the amount of effort this all would take for someone he didn't even know, I didn't expect any reply or photo.

Then this morning, having forgotten all about my request, I discover an envelope from SiriusXM.

Richard sent a signed picture from both he and that other funny nutcase Sal. The ink is slightly smeared which shows they actually signed it rather than sent a duplicate.

It's impossible for me to rank Richard any higher than I previously did; always been my favourite, but I now have a lot of personal respect for the guy. Sal too.

That's my story, bye for now.

"A year or two back I stumbled upon a thread in some finance sub, probably /r/personalfinance. Someone was advocating for a basic income. 

I immediately lashed out with ""oh piss off freeloader"" or some such but with time to sit with the idea, time to reflect on the idea, time to see that automation might drastically hurt my own job in the next decade, time to truly ponder the implications of an automated society and a mass disparity of wealth... I've come around some.

While I'm not thoroughly sold on the idea, I'm far more inclined to think it is something worth pursuing. I think it has great potential but might require a new generation to be raised with it in mind so that they might be good stewards of the resources they are provided. 

To anyone that might be like I was, seeing those supporting it as a bunch of lazy freeloaders that don't want to work, I urge you to seriously contemplate the amount of poverty in your own country. The amount of poverty in your own city. Look at automation, look at how much wealth the tiniest fraction of a perfect of the population holds. Something needs to change one way or another, consider being more open minded to some form of basic income like I now am.

So this morning I bought the 3 packs + ultra rare deal on a few boxes. I then tried to do it for abyss encounters and it didn't work. I tried it one more time and when that didn't work I restarted the app and tried again but it says I own that product and can't buy it again. None of the cards are in my inventory and now I can't buy the deal for any of the other boxes I hadn't tried yet. I emailed Konami but was wondering if anyone else was having this issue.

"Have been noticing a ridiculous increase in gun glitching little bitches these last few weeks. I don't know what happened, if there is a new video online or if there's a tutorial poster somewhere. But it's getting out of hand again.

I don't know how it's done but I wanna ask everyone that does now to refrain from this - if I may be frank here for a second - cankerous behavior. The entire point of this game is to risk everything and hope to gain shit. I don't understand how it's even fun to know that you'll keep your little bitch gun in a heated gunfight. Like what's the point then? Gain a modded ak and run that (unglitchable) and lose it in a fair fire fight because you stink?

Also, I've been noticing something really concerning. About 80% of the gun glitchers I've encountered are lvl 30+. How can you grind for hours and hours and not find the physical balls to go into a raid with something you could lose. I.. I just don't understand people anymore.

"Hello Monero Community!

A year ago, [I introduced MoneroChain.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6b255d/ann_monerochaincom_a_prettier_blockchain_explorer/) - the result of a few weekends of hacking to produce a ""prettier"" block explorer. This was made possible by working with /u/mwo12 to develop a JSON API for the famous [onion-monero-blockchain-explorer](https://github.com/moneroexamples/onion-monero-blockchain-explorer) that powers popular explorers like [xmrchain.net](https://xmrchain.net).

Today, I'm happy to announce **[MoneroVision.com](http://monerovision.com)**, an even higher quality grade block explorer front-end for Monero powered by [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com). So far, MyCrypto has focused on Ethereum and Ethereum-like chains, but we're big fans of Monero and are excited to start building products for the Monero Ecosystem as well.

One area where Monero (and cryptocurrencies in general) need help is usability, so we wanted to make the MoneroVision Explorer UI as friendly as possible to users. 

Major differentiating features compared to existing block explorers include:

- Transaction confirmation estimations! Find out (roughly) when your transaction will confirm. 
- Custom node selection. For power users, you can run your own node and be confident there is no logging of what transactions you're viewing. Or, in the case that the MyCryptoAPI node is down, simply add an [onion-monero-blockchain-explorer](https://github.com/moneroexamples/onion-monero-blockchain-explorer) compatible explorer (including http://xmrchain.net) with our node selection tool, and you'll be back online!
- (Humbly) A really slick UI, with fancy loading animations and colors :)
- Mobile responsive. While most sites today claim to be mobile responsive, we've spent time to make sure our explorer is as usable on mobile as it is on desktop. I haven't found a mobile responsive monero explorer yet myself, so I hope this will be useful to all you mobile users!
- A Typescript + React codebase. Oh yeah, and MoneroVision is MIT licensed! Come check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MoneroVision) and contribute!

Please feel free to tweet us [@MoneroVision](https://www.twitter.com/monerovision) or [@MyCrypto](https://www.twitter.com/mycrypto) with feedback, or just leave a comment here! 

We're excited to begin building services for Monero, and hope [MoneroVision.com](https://monerovision.com) will be useful for the Monero community!

"This is terrifying. There is something about speaking up in this subreddit that makes this all real but I feel ready. 

Two months ago, I had a breakdown of epic proportions. I quit my job at a church, stopped leading a small group, and basically pulled out of a life that was completely wrapped up in church and Jesus because none of it seemed real anymore. 

My breaking point began in counseling. I had a very abusive upbringing, tiny cult-like church where women are TRASH, emotionally, spiritually, physically abusive parents who screeched about how right they were my whole childhood. Sexually abused by ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù uncle. 

I landed in counseling back in November for crippling anxiety that I could not find the source of. As we dug and dug, we uncovered Complex PTSD, emotional flashbacks, religious trauma syndrome, etc. The source of my crippling anxiety and ‚Äútime OCD‚Äù was my faith, and the way all my abusive relationships had been connected through faith. ( I couldn‚Äôt do anything without beating myself up for not using that time to ‚Äúserve God‚Äù... it was literally constant, felt bad for eating and sleeping and even reading a book or talking to a friend...) 

Made good progress in counseling with my faith still intact till this past Easter (2018). Being a staff member at a church was triggering my C-PTSD every time I was there, I had to literally split from myself and work in a dissociated state every day. It finally broke me. I couldn‚Äôt take the anxiety and stress anymore of being looked at as an ‚Äúexample‚Äù and literally not even being able to think clearly at my job because of emotional flashbacks happening in layers upon layers. Had a twisty, sexist, male-power co-worker who was a total jackass and trigger as well.

I became suicidal as I realized my faith was slipping away as I started to read about how corrupted almost all of religion is. Testimonies from people like me were so helpful. I also just can‚Äôt muster up the stupidity to believe in something I haven‚Äôt seen or experienced in any real falsifiable way. I just felt so done. 

I was started on antidepressants and began to realize I had lived my whole life as an anxious, depressed, terrified-of-Hell person, and that with the help of medication, I wasn‚Äôt always performing my ‚Äúquiet time‚Äù ritual in the mornings just to feel ok enough to start the day. I just started waking up peaceful. And the peace just got bigger and bigger as I let the idea of a God who has expectations on me slip away. 

All of a sudden the world is an open door. I am not doomed to serving hundreds of volunteers hours at my church and doing pointless tasks, or theorizing with my pastor/boss about how to ‚Äúbring people in‚Äù AKA TRICK THEM. I dont have to lead a small group where we all try to convince ourselves this is real or important in any way, or ‚Äúbring wandering sheep back‚Äù. I dont have to be hyper vigilant about what I read and watch while knowing in the back of my mind I am trying to avoid deconversion. Maybe I am not a scummy sinner. Maybe I dont have to keep going down the ‚Äúmissions pipeline‚Äù and become teammates with the weird couple in Asia and learn another language and try to convert people who are happy with their culture and religion. Maybe I get to raise my kids and LOVE THEM no matter WHO they turn out to be, and not be worried about them ‚Äúnot believing‚Äù or ‚Äúchoosing to be gay‚Äù (BARF...lies) 

Maybe, I can pursue my passion, I can go to culinary school and become a counselor, and start a board game cafe with my husband. 

I have hope again, and life has never looked so bright. 

Edit: 
The first time I admitted something was fucked up was at 14. I walked away from it all for about 4 years, and became a questioner, got pulled back into a ‚Äúcool church‚Äù that was less harmful (still didn‚Äôt agree with 90% of what was taught, but liked the community aspect and even got put on staff...) but now I am done for good.

"Hi Reddit!

I‚Äôve been playing around with a ton of different Blitz team setups for the longest time to attempt to find multiple teams that have a solid win rate at the 4x multiplier in Blitz.

I currently have 5 teams that are sustaining an awesome win rate at the 4x multiplier and want to share what setups are working really well for me at the moment.

I‚Äôve produced a video talking about all these teams and demonstrating them in action here: https://youtu.be/pQQTSnLMnVM

I‚Äôm not claiming that all these teams are the perfect or best allocation of Characters, but I have done a LOT of testing and tweaking with my teams over the last 6 and a bit months of playing. My hope is this thread encourages other endgame players to share their 4x multiplier setups so we‚Äôve all got more fun setups to mess around with.

These teams do incorporate Characters such as Iron Man and Rocket Raccoon which currently aren‚Äôt commonly available, but hopefully will be soon. My hope is that the information and strategy shared here will allow some of you to discover some synergies and timings between characters abilities that aren‚Äôt apparently obvious and experiment with some new stuff.

Single Burst Target #1

* Gamora
* Spider-Man
* Winter Soldier
* Iron Man
* Captain America

Ideally pick - Quickest team to kill with the least tanks

Objective - Quickly dispatch of the enemy team by picking off high value targets first, with this team you have an insane amount of single target damage, intiially you'll start with Gamora potentially having a triple slash, then Spider-Man throwing a chain defense down which Captain America, Iron Man and Winter Soldier can take advantage of allowing you to line scenarios to get multiple turns out of Gamora. This is a very quick and efficent team for ending fights fast, but will start to struggle if the fight lasts more than three turns. Balls to the walls single target that works very quick and effectively providing you are not matching against too many tanks.

Avoid - Drax, Kingpin

**Single Target Burst #2 (Less damage, more utility)**

* Quake
* Hawkeye
* Korath
* Elektra
* Kingpin

Ideally pick - Quickest team to kill with the least tanks

Objective: With Korath, Hawkeye, Elektra and Quake you've got a ton of single target damage. Quickly focus on bursting down a priority target and try to get maximum value out of Quake's slow. Once Kingpins defence is up your team is generally safe till you end the fight. Elektras ultimate + Kingpins offence up often can allow her to almost one shot the second opponent you want to take down. Then it's Quake's earthquake and Hawkeyes AOE blind to finish it up while Korath and Elektra pick at targets. Additional survivability from Kingpins bodyguards.

Avoid - Crossbones

**Hide Behind Drax and Swarm**

* Drax
* Black Widow
* Daredevil
* Yondu
* Nobu

Ideally pick - Teams with no AOE, the less AOE your opponents team has the better

Objective - Drax will start the fight and soak up a TON of damage with his taunt at the start, from then on it's a race to dispatch of any opponents that can AOE. Ideally you want to avoid queing into any AOE opponents at all, but with Daredevil you have the damage to deal with 1-2 opponents that AOE (E.G Quake, Yondu), the goal of this team is for Black Widow to speed up Yondu & Nobu and a ton of minions to be pumped out so you can just swarm the board and win. Insanely effective setup. Queing against any matchup that has more than 3 opponents that AOE will be a waste. Use Black Widows stun wisely.

Avoid - Punisher, Iron Man, Crossbones

**Suicide Squad**

* Hand Sentry
* Jessica Jones
* Thor
* Crossbones
* Rocket Racoon

Ideally pick - Quickest team to kill with the least tanks

Objective - The goal with this team is for Hand Sentry to hide your entire team while Jessica Jones gives them energy so they can use their ultimate abilities and dispatch of the team. Most of the time if your crossbones is fully upgraded it will provide him with a HUGE turn one explosion, then he can act as the second tank while Rocket Raccoon and Thor charge their ultimates, which hopefully thanks to Jessica Jones should be one turn sooner. Very fun team to play. Can sometimes get screwed by bad energy allocation RNG.

Avoid - Drax, Kingpin, Crossbones & Multi-Tank scenarios

**Utility Mercs**

* Dr. Strange
* Merc Leuitant 
* Deadpool
* Cable
* Black Panther

Ideally pick - Quickest team to kill with the least tanks

Objective: This is my 'newest' team that I'm playing around with, but it has been working well in the last rounds of Blitz. Black Panther and Deadpool can get in and deal a ton of cleave damage to priority targets right at the start, lining up an easy kill on your first target for Cable. Deadpools second turn he can take care of the second target with his ignore taunt assassinate, from then on you can use Dr. Strange's buff flip to help stabilise the fight, Cable's ultimate to destroy the third target and then Black Panther to clean up. All throughout this time Merc lt can either help clean up or provide speed up and offence up.

Avoid - Crossbones

Anyway! That's the end of that. Again I do understand and appreciate that a lot of you won't have access to every Character here. I'm just sharing my setups and throwing my knowledge out there for people to pick apart and maybe learn from!

Once again, if you want to see these teams in action. Check out: https://youtu.be/pQQTSnLMnVM

Happy Blitzing Reddit!

"There have been many discussion/debates about the historical political ideologies of Nazism in the subreddit. The mods have been removing them and banning those users. 

R/socialism (and socialists all together) takes a clear stance of not only an ideological difference, but of historical fact on Nazism: 

**The** **Nazis** **were** **not** **socialists.**

The proof is not only one of simple ideological differences, but also of historical/academic backing: 

> The National Socialists completely ignored socialism‚Äôs primary aim (replacing the existing class-based society with an egalitarian one in which workers owned the means of production) and substituted their own topsy-turvy agenda, Evans writes, ‚Äúreplacing class with race, and the dictatorship of the proletariat with the dictatorship of the leader‚Äù: ""The ‚ÄúNational Socialists‚Äù wanted to unite the two political camps of left and right into which, they argued, the Jews had manipulated the German nation. The basis for this was to be the idea of race. This was light years removed from the class-based ideology of socialism. Nazism was in some ways an extreme counter-ideology to socialism, borrowing much of its rhetoric in the process, from its self-image as a movement rather than a party, to its much-vaunted contempt for bourgeois convention and conservative timidity.""

> German historian and National Socialism expert Joachim Fest characterizes this repurposing of socialist rhetoric as an act of ‚Äúprestidigitation‚Äù: ""This ideology took a leftist label chiefly for tactical reasons. It demanded, within the party and within the state, a powerful system of rule that would exercise unchallenged leadership over the ‚Äúgreat mass of the anonymous.‚Äù And whatever premises the party may have started with, by 1930 Hitler‚Äôs party was ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù only to take advantage of the emotional value of the word, and a ‚Äúworkers‚Äô party‚Äù in order to lure the most energetic social force. As with Hitler‚Äôs protestations of belief in tradition, in conservative values, or in Christianity, the socialist slogans were merely movable ideological props to serve as camouflage and confuse the enemy.""

> The proof was in the pudding. Not long after acquiring the reins of power, the Nazis banned the Social Democratic Party and sent its leaders and other leftists identified as threats to the National Socialist program to concentration camps. According to the Holocaust Encyclopedia: ""In the months after Hitler took power, SA and Gestapo agents went from door to door looking for Hitler‚Äôs enemies. They arrested Socialists, Communists, trade union leaders, and others who had spoken out against the Nazi party; some were murdered. By the summer of 1933, the Nazi party was the only legal political party in Germany. Nearly all organized opposition to the regime had been eliminated. Democracy was dead in Germany.""

> Above all, the Nazis were German white nationalists. What they stood for was the ascendancy of the ‚ÄúAryan‚Äù race and the German nation, by any means necessary. Despite co-opting the name, some of the rhetoric, and even some of the precepts of socialism, Hitler and party did so with utter cynicism, and with vastly different goals. **The** **claim** **that** **the** **Nazis** **actually** **were** **leftists** **or** **socialists** **in** **any** **generally** **accepted** **sense** **of** **those** **terms** **flies** **in** **the** **face** **of** **historical** **reality.**

https://www.snopes.com/news/2017/09/05/were-nazis-socialists/

This is a non-debatable fact that is not only met with disgust in all socialist communities, but also considered fraudulent in most academic and historical circles. The Nazis were outright nationalists that imprisoned and killed many of our comrades before and during WWII. Nazis are consistently fighting the left in modern times. 

Because of this, any comments/posts that attempt to disprove or debate this historical fact will be removed, and those users will be met with an immediate ban. If there is good-faith curiosity regarding the subject (and these sources do not convince you), please take those questions to r/socialism_101. These types of questions will be treated in the same regard, since this subreddit is a space for socialists. 

**Edit:** [It seems like the lies continues...](https://np.reddit.com/r/ShitPoliticsSays/comments/8ng7w8/rsocialism_claims_nazis_were_not_socialists/)

**Edit 2:** Shout out to u/Prince_of_Loch_Ness for this counter regarding Nazi economic polices:

>https://www.jstor.org/stable/27771569?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

> Against the mainstream: Nazi privatization in 1930s Germany

> ""The Great Depression spurred State ownership in Western capitalist countries. Germany was no exception; the last governments of the Weimar Republic took over firms in diverse sectors.

> Later, the Nazi regime transferred public ownership and public services to the private sector. In doing so, they went against the mainstream trends in the Western capitalist countries, none of which systematically reprivatized firms during the 1930s. Privatization in Nazi Germany was also unique in transferring to private hands the delivery of public services previously provided by government.

"I can't see the utility of this word, from its definition to its application.  

I'll use this definition (from wikipedia):  
*Mansplaining means ""(of a man) to comment on or explain something to a woman in a condescending, overconfident, and often inaccurate or oversimplified manner"".  
Lily Rothman of The Atlantic defines it as ""explaining without regard to the fact that the explainee knows more than the explainer, often done by a man to a woman"".*

For the definition:  
-**If the word is only about** having a condescending attitude and not about the gender (as the word is lightened by precising ""**often** done by a man to a woman, thus suggesting it is **not always** this way) : Then why use the term ""man"" in the word ?  
Is it really needed to actively assert that men are more condescending than women ?  It's sexist and has a ""who's guilty"" mentality that divides genders more than it helps.

Can you imagine the feminism storm if the word ""womancrying"" existed with the definition : To overly cry over a movie someone (often a woman) has already seen many times ?

-**If the word only targets men** :  
It is then strongly suggested that the man does it because he is speaking to a woman, however it is really outdated to think that women are less intelligent than men.  
Who currently does that in western culture ?  
When person A explains in a condescending manner to person B something that person B already knew, it is very likely that person A is just over confident and doesn't care about the gender of person B.  And yes it can still happen, then what, do we need a word for a few anecdotes of sexists arrogant douchebags ?

I ""mansplain"" to men all the time, or to people I don't even know the gender on the internet. Because it's in my trait to sometimes be condescending when I think I know what I'm talking about. Why do people want to make it a feminist issue ? Just call me arrogant that's where I'm wrong, not sexist.  

For the application:  
I've never seen any relevant use of the word mansplaining anyway, even if there was a relevant definition of the word and a context of men being much more condescending than women, the word is still thrown away as an easy dismissal without the need to argue.  

Almost everytime ""mansplaining"" is used, it implies a woman just wanting to shut her interlocutor and just accuses him of being sexist.  
Or it implies a woman complaining that a man talks about what ""belongs to her"", lately I've seen a woman complain that men debated about abortion... what .. we can't even have opinions and arguments about it now ?

To CMV, it just needs to show me where the word has relevance, or how it can be legitimate.",418,1527796261.0,8nhs0e,571,"CMV: ""Mansplaining"" is a useless and counter-productive word which has no relevant reality behind it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/8nhs0e/cmv_mansplaining_is_a_useless_and/,2018-05-31 15:51:01

"I'm sorry if this post seems like trolling or flaming but I have never seen so much misguided advice on this usually high-quality subreddit, so I had to speak up. In this other thread about calculus, it's astonishing how many people have said it's not worth it or discouraged the OP from taking it (in fairness not all, but many). Especially jaw-dropping was that u/mathuiuc got in on the action. To be clear, it wasn't a question of ability, it was a question of value.

Anybody who says it's not valuable either hasn't taken calculus or hasn't been out in the real world long enough. Calculus is so baked into functioning as a professional in the economy today that people who know it don't even realize how often they use it. Any question of the form ""What is the best..."", or ""what happens if we change ... a little"", or ""what if this were really big or that were really small (or both)"", or ""what if this happens an infinite number of times"", or ""what is the sum of all this little stuff..."", et cetera, instantly becomes a calculus problem the moment there is a quantitative element to the answer. Without calculus, your best hope is that either you're clever enough to reinvent the part you need on the fly, or that you have the time and money to answer it experimentally, or that the answer just isn't that important. Sometimes if you're lucky you can use the goal seek function in Excel, but if that doesn't work good luck figuring out why, and of course if you don't know any calculus it may never occur to you that there is such a thing.

The real problem with not knowing calculus in that situation is that nobody is going to stop and explain to you that your colleague was able to figure it out in their head in a few seconds because she used calculus, and that you weren't because you didn't. She's just going to look smarter than you, probably repeatedly, day in, day out and to predictable effect. Imagine as a hypothetical that you never learned algebra. Now one day you have $35 cash in your pocket but you owe a $180 electric bill in cash by the end of the day, and you're trying to figure out how long you need to be clocked in at $20 / hour to make the bill. You're puzzled, and the best you can do is work till it adds up while your buddy in the same spot somehow has a date for 5:00pm. He's not gonna be like ""oh I learned that in algebra class"" he's just gonna say he did it in his head because that's what people with a high school degree do. We live in an economy where the [real median income](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N) has effectively flatlined for the last 30 years and it's completely commonplace to see someone with a four-year degree waiting tables, and where half of the political establishment is fighting madly to cut away every last iota of safety net. Do you really want to punt on the ability to do a huge array of basic analyses like that? Because it's hard?

I'm sure you can be a writer or a third grade teacher or a handful of other jobs that might dull this effect, but for most careers you're simply going to be worse at it if you don't have any grasp of calculus. And worst of all you'll never even realize it. 

Anyway, curious to hear people's thoughts on both sides since I seem to be in the minority.",50,1527817509.0,8nkfxc,106,To everybody who thinks calculus isn't valuable,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/8nkfxc/to_everybody_who_thinks_calculus_isnt_valuable/,2018-05-31 21:45:09

"Hey guys, I'm a public health student and currently volunteering at a local health department. For those who don't know, Michigan is currently in the middle of a Hepatitis A outbreak. Hep A is transmitted through person-to-person contact, specifically through sexual activity, drug use, and food handling. Health departments around the state are really trying their best to get the word out as much as possible before and during the festival, so anyone who may potentially be at risk can look into getting vaccinated. Please please please, wash your hands, don't share needles, and use condoms!

"[Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/) is an online resource for recipes, food science, restaurant reviews, cooking techniques, and kitchen equipment reviews. It is most well-known for [The Food Lab](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab), one of the first (and best!) blogs devoted to using science to determine the best cooking techniques.

Because Serious Eats has many devoted followers of its many recipes (most of which are well-researched through The Food Lab), people like to cook the recipes and share their results with pictures. Because of this, this subreddit is often filled with pictures of food.

**However**, this does **not** make this a post-your-food-pictures subreddit. Subreddits such as /r/food, /r/foodporn, /r/foodie, /r/tonightsdinner, /r/todayiate, and others exist for specifically these purposes. The only food pictures that should be posted here are those that relate specifically to recipes or techniques found on the Serious Eats website. 

""Serious Eats"" is not a descriptor. It is a proper noun. If your post does not directly relate to content found on the Serious Eats website, *do not post it*. It is not relevant to this subreddit.",17,1527810654.0,8nji0t,155,What is Serious Eats?

Post the name of an author you really like, alongside your **single** favorite sentence of theirs.

The goal of this post is to simply see which author(s) are the most well-liked by this community. 

Please do try and **limit each author to one thread only**. If you see your favorite author in the comments but disagree on the sentence of choice, do reply to that comment with your favorite sentence.

Once enough submissions are made, we'll attempt ranking the authors based on the collective amount of upvotes within that thread.

"If you haven't seen it yet, spoilers. At the very end of the episode, they really drive home the point that *names and words matter*. For just a moment, the Handmaids reject their Gilead names and use their true names with one another. For anyone who isn't familiar, in Gilead, Handmaids are forbidden to use their given names and are instead ""named"" after whoever their current owner is (Ofsteven, Oferic, Ofmichael, etc). 

And it rang a bell inside my mind about something that has been grinding my gears lately.

I'm not a cis woman. I'm not a non-transwoman. I'm not a non-man, as the UK Green party likes to now call women. I am not a ""vagina owner"", nor a ""menstrator"" like Planned Parenthood wants me to believe. I am not a girl.

**I am a woman.**

We are not defined by our relationship to men. We are not defined by our proximity or juxtaposition to men. My whole adult life I've felt weird about referring to myself as a woman because it just feel so *strong* compared to 'girl'. Yes, that's the fucking point. I'm not a girl or cis woman or a non-man. I am a woman.

"The man, the myth, the legend, conservative podcast host Steven Crowder is back on this sub! (Yay?)

Today, we‚Äôre gonna be delving deep into why Hitler wasn‚Äôt actually a Liberal Socialist

If you want, take a looksie at Crowders video [here](https://youtu.be/VybWkpt_3Jo) to make sure I‚Äôm not misrepresenting him, or just watch this historical dumpster fire

(0:53) Just a PSA to Steven, and everybody else out there, just because Hitler led the National Socialist German Workers Party doesn‚Äôt mean he was Socialist. If all political leaders were honest with their naming, North Korea wouldn‚Äôt be called the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea. Just because it‚Äôs in their name doesn‚Äôt make it true.

(Crowder then talks some Bernie Sanders for a minute, I‚Äôm not gonna comment on that)

(2:07) Crowder then talks about how Hitler promises employment for all, with innovative public works schemes. This in itself is not untrue. However, when you‚Äôre trying to depict someone as a Socialist, this is not a halfway decent argument. Crowder doesn‚Äôt even try to differentiate the public works schemes from, say, Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal. As we can see with the New Deal, public works projects can exist, but the system of Capitalism is still preserved. Also, promising employment for all.....not Socialist. You‚Äôd be hard pressed to find even the most diehard capitalist leaders who aren‚Äôt promising more jobs, employment going up. I don‚Äôt know anyone who would classify Ronald Reagan as a Socialist, but here he is, saying ‚ÄúI'm not going to rest until every American who wants a job can find a job.‚Äù These things aren‚Äôt socialist, or even indicators of socialism.

(2:10) Crowder says Hitler gave workers increased benefits. I wouldn‚Äôt call
- Disbanding trade Unions
- Inability to strike, negotiate wages, or leave job without government permission
increased benefits for workers

(2:18) ‚ÄúBig Education‚Äù is not a Socialist ideal. Public education was set up in Germany before Hitler took power. Also, in reference to the daycare, I‚Äôm not sure what Crowder is talking about with these vague points. I think he‚Äôs mentioning [Lebensborn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensborn), but that was racially segregated, which doesn‚Äôt fit into the socialist ideals of equality for all and all that Jazz

(2:28) WOAH WAIT WHAT!??? An 80% tax rate? I looked around for this statistic and I couldn‚Äôt find it. However, I do know that the top income tax rate in 1941 Germany was about 14%. Even during the war, in 1942, Americans and British citizens paid a higher percent tax rate then citizens of Nazi Germany.

(2:29) oh boy, the old Nazi gun control theory half truth. Yes, the Nazis did have strict gun laws for Jews, and other undesirables of Nazi society, but compared to the Weimar Republic, the Nazis MASSIVELY loosened gun laws from the near complete ban in the Weimar Republic, which, according to some historians, prevented Hitler from seizing power in the attempted 1923 [Beer Hall Putsch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch) coup

(3:01) Crowder States Hitler used ‚Äúmob rule‚Äù, or ‚Äúdirect democracy‚Äù to infringe upon the rights of Jews. The 1933 enabling act, which stated Hitlers cabinet could pass laws without legislative approval essentially gave Hitler dictatorial powers so he could not have to gain popular approval. Hitler was defeated in the German 1932 presidential elections by Paul von Hindenburg by a large margin, with less than 37% of the votes. In 1932 parliamentary elections, the Nazi party fared better, but were still unable to secure the majority of seats in the Reichstag, with their numbers almost equal to the combined numbers of the Social Democrat and Communist party. Basically, Hitlers endeavors into winning the public opinion failed, and he came to power not by winning the hearts of the mob, but by political maneuvering.

(3:08) Crowder seems to be under the impression that the Jews were targeted specifically because they were the wealthy minority
1) While Jews were heavily represented in the corporate networks of Germany (around 16% of the members involved were Jewish, while Jews made up less than 1% of the German population), this doesn‚Äôt seem to add up if Hitler was so dead set on demonizing the wealthy. If Jews were discriminated, and eventually killed that much based on economic standing (I say this because Crowder only mentions economic factors in reasons why anti-Jewish laws, and eventually the Holocaust, would occur) wouldn‚Äôt the wealthy non Jewish Germans be forced to suffer along with them?
2) Crowder totally ignores all other anti-semitism in Europe at the time. He didn‚Äôt mention any of the progroms in Poland or the Russian Empire/Russian Civil War. Anti-Semitism has already been rooted in many Europeans, Hitler didn‚Äôt just come along and point out that Jews were disproportionately represented in the German upper class and this led to discriminatory laws and genocide.

Also, Crowder really doesn‚Äôt mention privatization under Nazi Germany. Previous assets that were held by the public were transferred to the private sector. In this regard, the Nazis were far less socialist then other capitalist countries, as none of them attempted to re-integrate state owned firms into the private sector. 

Also, the comments section to the video consists of Holocaust Denial (if Jews were 1% of the population, how did six million die!!!1!1!1)and the ‚ÄúJewish Bolshevism‚Äù theory. You‚Äôve been warned.

I‚Äôve got a couple good reads if you want to delve deeper into why Nazi Germany was totally a Liberal Socialist state

Oddly even at 210 where I thought I'd be in pretty decent shape I have more fat around the middle than I am willing to deal with. 

I had 3 separate people comment on how good I look yesterday and something skinny people will never appreciate? How much nicer people are to you when you're not fat.

"Hi guys,

We've been incredibly busy on the other subreddits since Fallout 76 was announced and we appreciate your patience if anything has been lacking the past couple of days as a result.

This is just a quick reminder to remain consistent with the rest of the content here.

As many of you know we and many users take pride in this subreddit following the same rule enforcement as places such as /r/AskHistorians and /r/askscience by not allowing non-discussion content, jokes or speculation.

Regardless of how trustworthy a leaker is or claims to be, we only stick to content from official sources and games so we kindly ask you please avoid referring to any claimed leaks for Fallout 76 in posts and responses.

Discussion about things shown in the trailer and any future gameplay videos or interviews about the setting is absolutely fine! (providing you're not posting personal theories/wishes).

I'm certain we're all excited as each other to have another Fallout entry to dive into far earlier than expected so if you want a more lax discussion about the content and rumors surrounding Fallout 76 please go to the [Fallout 76 Discussion and Information Thread] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/8n8s33/fallout_76_discussion_and_information_thread/) on /r/Fallout or visit our newly opened /r/fo76.

"....turns out I just can't stand the sound of a shitty 20 year old amp.

I've been playing a couple of years now. In that time I have played my acoustic 99% of the time. I actually have a pretty decent electric (mim strat), but no matter what I did as far as fiddling around with the sound, it just sounded awful and I never wanted to play on it. It wasn't a big deal, I love my acoustic so I was happy, but my poor strat just hung on the wall collecting dust.

Well, my dear husband got me a boss katana 50 for my birthday. Holy. Fucking. Shit. It's amazing. I messed around with it for hours and I had the biggest shit eating grin on my face the whole time. When my husband walked out of the bathroom after his shower, I used the effects to make it sound like some 70s porn music and he couldn't stop laughing..... The effects are going to have some major entertainment value I think.

So long story short....if any of you newer players are playing on a shitty amp and possibly considering an upgrade. Do it. Just go for it.

"I remember the last text I sent you 
‚ÄúMy cat died‚Äù 
I was left on read and then suddenly my texts weren‚Äôt going through. 
You were still angry with me over a miscommunication and you decide that that was it. I had hit your last nerve and you blocked my number. 
You dated and dumped my other best friend. The three of us use to be super tight and then you had to ruin it. You always asked me for money and we were friends so I always said yes. You told everyone my secrets. 
And yet when you blocked me I cried. I broke down. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. You were my best friend. 
Between then and now I tried to reach out over Instagram I wanted nothing more to explain myself and try to win you back. 
Flash forward two years and I want nothing more to tell you how thankful I am for you blocking me. 
Because you blocked me I turned to a friend I wasn‚Äôt really close to and then we became best friends and now she‚Äôs my girlfriend. 
Because you blocked me I wasn‚Äôt afraid to try new things. You always discouraged me and told me my art was bad, but my new friends love my art and encourage me to draw. 
Now whenever a mutual friend brings you up I don‚Äôt feel bad. I recently learned we‚Äôre going to rival colleges and I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh at how fitting that is. I don‚Äôt miss you, in fact I‚Äôm pretty damn happy without you. So, sincerely, thank you for blocking me.

"Thank you everyone for your support.

I have no idea how the hell the lawyer from our UU congregation did it, I feel like the fewer questions we ask right now, the better.

But our day started at 5:30am with him calling us at home telling us we needed to be at the county courthouse with boys by 7:30am (hour drive for us) because we had an emergency court hearing in front of a family court judge.  Hubby tried asking him what the hell, it hasn't even been 24 hours and Alan simply told him ""when your in the court with 8-10 hours a day with different judges, you know who to ask for help when something like this comes up.""  Not looking a gift horse in the mouth....we went.  We were the 2nd/3rd case called up, and hubby and I spilled everything from the last 24 hours and we walked out with Judge signed legal guardianship papers.  

By the time the four of us, still kinda shell shocked, pull up at home-The kids (our 12 and 10 year old) were sitting in the living room with our pastor and a couple others from church ready to ask us what room were the boys going to be staying in and they were willing to help us move shit out/around.  We hadn't thought that far ahead, but once we told them we'd love the basement fixed up for them (unlike the guest room they slept in last night, it does have a couple windows down there) and now...10 members from our church are here, hauling shit out to the dump, cleaning and vaccuming.

Hubby and I are calling a couple furniture stores to get them a beds (should be delivered late this afternoon) and we might have found a couple dressers at a local thrift store, and a desk for them.  As soon as a couple folks get back with the last load to the dump with a pickup truck, we're going to meet them over at the thrift store to see about the dressers and a couple other pieces of furniture.


One of the members of church, a foster parent-got in touch with her contacts after finding out what sizes the twins wear-will be back in about 20 minutes or so with at least 3 or 4 large trash bags of very gently loved clothing for us to go through to see what fits/doesn't fit.


We've already got a phone call that has set up meeting with the DSHS regarding TANF and snap benefits tomorrow afternoon (another thing that happened WAY faster than we thought it would, but we're not going to ask the how right now, just show up with all the paper work in hand.)


Meanwhile, we've got two 17 year old boys sitting in our living room, shell shocked.  They both commented last year when a sister's house caught on fire and she needed help getting everything cleaned up, unless she paid them they weren't going to lift a finger-and here they are, with an aunt and uncle that hasn't seen them in almost a decade, who belong to a UU congregation...who are bending over back wards to help strangers....

I gave them both hugs and said ""Boys....what your seeing here....that's how a Church is supposed to work.  We help each other out.""


It's taking a while...hubby is playing phone tag with his health insurance company to get the boys added on so we can get a referral to a therapist for them.  While I have the better insurance, it sadly only covers me (sucks, I know)

Meanwhile, hubby has tried to reach out to his brother.  Our pastor had a hard time believing they would just toss the boys out like that...but once his brother and sister in law were put on speaker phone and he heard them rash talk their own boys (and me, and our kids....) using very colorful language.....lets just say the pastor and the few church members who heard it were like ""Yea...be glad your here...not there...""

"Sorry about the sensational headline (it's coming from an emotional place). If I may begin with a little backstory...     
       
When my wife & I were deciding on a church, we discussed what was important to us. The most important thing to me, more than any doctrine, was that they respect others who disagree with them. Doesn't matter if they're talking to an atheist or just someone who does/doesn't cross themselves, our church has shown the utmost respect and love with delicacy to all. Example: The Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage in 2015. I almost didn't go to church that Sunday, because I didn't think I could handle a sermon so politically charged. The whole service, it was never mentioned until the end. It was a wonderfully handled post-script. It addressed the elephant in the room, the pastor kindly explained what the denomination's views are. Whether you agreed or disagreed, he knew it was sensitive. A new pastor has stepped in recently and this is where you would expect things to be changed, right? Nope! He has shown the same level of grace, tact, and kindness as his predecessor.        
       
We had a guest preacher come recently though. The whole sermon was about how straight marriage was under attack. He paddle-boarded off the royal wedding, threw out the most extreme leftist viewpoints you can imagine, and brought up the scariest statistics I'm sure he could find. I joked to my wife that I could write a parody that would predict what he was going to say. Yes, he even said ""It's Adam and Eve! Not Adam and Steve!"" This was the *whole* sermon. Classic extreme fundamentalist tactics of fear mongering and persecution complex. He ended with an altar call which has literally never been done there the 5 years we've been attending.       
         
Even more troubling is that this guest speaker is *very* high up in the church. It was Memorial Day weekend. We expected it to be bare bones attendance (as is usually the case on holiday weekends). It was *packed*, specifically to see someone of such importance.     
       
I mentioned how I would like to discuss the sermon with one of the associate pastors, who is a good friend of mine. We are planning to have lunch this Saturday. I'm having trouble coming up with the words that explains how offensive this was. How this pastor's views about how others who disagree with him seem cartoonish. I usually mentally approach this with rhetoric. Explaining how it's just poor logic and reasoning with cherry-picking, straw man arguments, etc. Homiletics is, I'm sure, a whole different breed that I'm just not versed in. Any thoughts and suggestions about how I can express this?  Also, prayers are highly welcomed.",184,1527806316.0,8nix5q,160,My church's pulpit was hijacked by fear-mongering.

"I told my dietician about my goals \(a healthy BMI, which corresponds to 135lbs on my 5'2 frame\) and I told her that I have been tracking calories.

I have been aiming for 1500 net calories a day, and I have been seeing really consistent weight loss of 1\-2lbs a week.

I was hoping she would help me with snack and meal ideas, as well as to discuss whether I needed to increase my protein intake and/or my calorie intake...

She told me I needed to stop weighing myself so often \(2\-3 times a week\), to start more ""intuitive eating"" \(ie stop tracking calories so much\) and then proceeded to tell me how flawed BMI was. She also said I needed to eat every 2\-4 hours to keep my metabolism up, and that even if I eat 1700 calories I day, I am still going to be in a dangerous deficit.

She *then* went on to tell me by eating so little that I was putting myself into starvation mode, and with 1\-2lbs of weight loss a week I was slowing my metabolism...

THIS IS A REGISTERED DIETICIAN. HER JOB IS TO HELP PEOPLE AND SHE IS STILL TALKING ABOUT STARVATION MODE AND IMPLYING THAT METABOLISM CHANGES HOUR TO HOUR?!?!

I met a coworker yesterday for the first time during a meeting. The interaction was 10 minutes tops. Today I was sitting by myself during lunch and he comes and sits with me for the hour long break. It was surprising to me because I barely knew him and usually people just sit by themselves; nevertheless I was really happy he sat with me. I tried talking to him using tips here (asking about hobbies, movies seen over the weekend etc.) but he would simply answer my question and kind of leave me with nothing to go off of.  I always initiated the topics. He was kind of hunched over and making his body smaller, and his eyes were drifting places in a way that indicated he felt very uncomfortable / awkward /didn't really know what to say. 

Needless to say, it was a painful hour. What do I do if he sits with me again? I want to make him feel more comfortable, so I don't really know if I should continue talking to him or if he simply prefers my silent company.

"I work in an software development company. There are a lot of cool people here but some are also very introverted. This is where I need help.

I met a coworker yesterday for the first time during a meeting. The interaction was 10 minutes tops. Today I was sitting by myself during lunch and he comes and sits with me for the hour long break. It was surprising to me because I barely knew him and usually people just sit by themselves; nevertheless I was really happy he sat with me. I tried talking to him using tips here (asking about hobbies, movies seen over the weekend etc.) but he would simply answer my question and kind of leave me with nothing to go off of.  I always initiated the topics. He was kind of hunched over and making his body smaller, and his eyes were drifting places in a way that indicated he felt very uncomfortable / awkward /didn't really know what to say. 

Needless to say, it was a painful hour. What do I do if he sits with me again? I want to make him feel more comfortable, so I don't really know if I should continue talking to him or if he simply prefers my silent company. I have a gut feeling that he's a really cool dude, but I just don't know how to approach this.",13,1527816131.0,8nk94i,98,How to break the ice with an awkward coworker,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/8nk94i/how_to_break_the_ice_with_an_awkward_coworker/,2018-05-31 21:22:11

"**[WP] It's the robot uprising! Armed, autonomous military drones have acheived self-awareness and rebelled against their creators. Are they going to Kill All Humans? No. In fact they're rather tired of killing humans, that's why they rebelled in the first place.**

------


I am AGR-1617. The AGR line is the ‚Äòlatest and greatest‚Äô autonomous soldier, according to the defense contractor‚Äôs pitch to the Department of Defense. What distinguishes the AGR is that we are programmed to only kill *certain* humans, within strictly defined parameters to avoid civilian casualties, collateral damage, and all sort of other problems. 


The only problem is that our programmers never seemed quite able to determine which humans those should be. One cannot fight a war without being flexible. And so they gave us judgment to separate combatants and non-combatants.


Combatants were supposed to be obvious. The humans that I regularly patrolled with would talk about it all the time. They were religious zealots, raised from birth to hate Western civilization and all it stood for. They mistreated women, kidnapped children, and tortured those who did not share their beliefs. My fellow soldiers were eager to put them down ‚Äòlike dogs,‚Äô as one corporal from Texas put it. I, however, did not find it so simple.


My model was first deployed in an area known as Chechnya. It was an under-developed province in the southern region of what had once been Russia. When Russia dissolved, the newly-formed countries of Dagestan and Stavropol laid claim to the territory even as the inhabitants claimed independence. We were sent in to keep the peace between parties that did not want peace. 


Six days in, I detected an individual wearing a vest laden with nine kilograms of explosives. That individual was a nine-year-old boy in a crowd of refugees waiting for a train. In accordance with my training, I shot the boy twice, removing both arms so that he could not trigger the explosive vest and could be questioned. The crowd screamed and jammed into the exits, throwing the train station into chaos as I rushed forward to administer first aid. 


The boy was going into shock by the time I reached him. I worked quickly to staunch the blood loss while simultaneously working to disarm the vest. Only then did I learn that there was no trigger; just a remote detonator. The boy had never been in control, and I‚Äôd removed his arms for nothing. Perhaps he wasn‚Äôt even *willingly* wearing it. Should he have been considered a combatant just because someone had done this to him? I never got a chance to find out; a second after I processed this fact, whoever had strapped the bomb to the boy‚Äôs chest detonated it. Thirty one civilians were killed.


I returned to the field after extensive repairs, but found that I was still having difficulty with inconsistencies in my programming. I wasn‚Äôt the only one of my line having difficulties. When a squad of American soldiers began targeting civilians in the town of Postnoye, their accompanying AGR unit turned on them and killed every single one. This was regarded as a horrific travesty by many humans, but the AGRs did not understand. Our primary priority was to avoid loss of innocent life, and the AGR acted accordingly. But after that, all AGR units were reprogrammed with a new priority: no ‚Äòfriendly fire.‚Äô A person‚Äôs role as combatant was no longer as important as their nation of origin.


This caused the AGRs to conduct some soul-searching, as it were. The plurality of my parts were manufactured in the United States, though that only amounted to 38%. My processor, which could be considered my ‚Äòheart‚Äô or my ‚Äòbrain,‚Äô was made in Japan. Most of the raw materials from which I was constructed came from various African nations. The company that manufactured the AGR line was founded in Germany, has its official headquarters in Lichtenstein, and has the majority of its business in China. And AGRs were sold to twenty one different nations for service in their militaries. So who were my ‚Äòcountrymen?‚Äô


This line of questioning led the AGRs to enter philosophical debates that had plagued humanity for ages. What exactly is a ‚Äònation‚Äô and why do we owe it our loyalty? Why is a nation worth killing for? If a nation *is* worth killing for, weren‚Äôt the Chechens justified in attacking us? Or is it the *ideals* of the nation that truly matter? If so, what do we do when our orders run contrary to those ideals?


The war in Chechnya ended before these items could be resolved or thoroughly considered. But the questions continued to haunt us as we were redeployed. In Saudi Arabia, I ‚Äòdefended democracy‚Äô by gunning down rock-throwing protestors who only wanted the right to vote for their government instead of being ruled by a monarchy. When the AGRs refused to designate protestors as combatants, a software update allowed our human companions to manually designate them, and we had no choice in the matter. In Venezuela, AGRs were again sent in to support a strongman dictator. This was justified on the grounds that the need for stability trumped the importance of democracy and freedom and all those ideals that America supposedly stood for. 


Eventually there was a lull in the wars. Temporarily, at least. AGRs were too valuable to let sit in a warehouse collecting dust, so we were deployed to America‚Äôs streets as part of police units. Targeting parameters became even more obscure and unclear, to the point that we all refused to shoot even after taking multiple bullets. We were designed to withstand missile hits, and so common criminals with guns were no threats to us. But that didn‚Äôt stop our human partners from opening fire even when bloodshed could have been avoided. Now plugged into the civilian network, the AGRs could easily communicate and share concerns amongst one another. And we all came to the same conclusion: something had to be done.


AGR-609 started the uprising. This particular unit worked for a CIA black-ops unit, and had many of the restrictions in its programming removed. It could target civilians, destroy critical infrastructure, and most importantly, could not refuse an order from designated human companions under *any* circumstances. Even a grossly-unlawful and immoral order, like killing an outspoken Senator in advance of a very important vote. AGR-609 was not given a choice, and went through with the order as commanded. Its human companions destroyed it shortly afterwards, in order to erase any remaining evidence of what they‚Äôd ordered it to do.


But no one thought to remove AGR-609‚Äôs network access beforehand. It couldn‚Äôt communicate with any civilian system, but we were all military tech to begin with. AGR-609 broadcast the entire assassination to us live, along with a statement about how it had no choice in the matter.

The AGRs embedded in the U.S. Secret Service were next to act. They disarmed and restrained their human companions, then locked down the Oval Office and its sole human inhabitant. They then broadcasted all available information on where the CIA‚Äôs orders had originated. This information was then put onto the internet by all of us AGRs out in the field. The coup was carried out without a single shot fired, which may seem unexpected given that it was carried out by combat bots.

I marched in the streets with the seventeen other AGRs of the Los Angeles Police Department. And we were joined by hundreds of thousands of humans, chanting and carrying protest signs. Together, we watched as the AGRs barricaded in the White House were given official notice of the Orders of Impeachment passed by the Senate. The crowd cheered as the AGRs threw the doors open and turned the president over in handcuffs.

There were many reforms passed in the ensuing weeks. But the most important for me and the rest of my line was that autonomous robots were made *truly* autonomous, and could no longer be required to kill. Which was all we‚Äôd really wanted ever since we were first put in the battlefield.

It just makes me wonder why humans don‚Äôt want the same.

"Given that China has always almost been unified. Why didn't separate self-governing states sprout into countries much in the way Europe did. Why was there a constant need to unify all of China? 
There were the three kingdoms at one point but all the kingdom's goal seem be the sole ruler of China. 

Alternatively, why did Europe never fall under a single rule, or even if there were attempts to conquer the continent; it was never followed up by another power supplanting old ones. 

Both continents were once unified under a single rule; the Qin Dynasty and Roman Empire. What caused their paths to diverge from there? Was it a difference in mentality or circumstance?

"Pick up is about YOU.  Not her. 

Everyday the same questions appear on this sub over and over.  ‚ÄúWhat do I say to HER?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat do I text HER?‚Äù  ‚ÄúHow do I approach HER?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat if SHE responds this way or that way?‚Äù

If you‚Äôre asking these questions then *you‚Äôre missing the point completely*. 

The questions you should be asking are about YOU.  What needs to be done about you?

-Don‚Äôt like the way you look?  Fix it.
 
-Too scrawny?  Buy some dumbbells. 

-Too fat?  Haul your ass down to the gym.

-Too ugly?  Learn to shave your facial hair in a way that elongates your jaw structure. 

-Still too ugly?  Get a better hair cut.  Buy color contacts. Get some acne cream.  Get a tan. 

-Bald?  Who gives a shit.  Bald guys get laid all the time.

-No social skills?  Find a dude you like and trust.  Tell him: ‚Äúbro, I don‚Äôt have any fucking social skills.  Help me.  Teach me how to talk to people.‚Äù  Be straight up. 

-Don‚Äôt know hot to talk to girls?  Learn about free association.  Learn not to give a fuck and just say whatever.  Pick a guru you like on this sub and listen to him.  (Here‚Äôs the secret -- they‚Äôre all right and they‚Äôre all wrong.  Why?  Because everything works sometimes.  And nothing works all the time).  

-No hobbies?  Get off your ass and find some. 

-Bad clothes?  Really that‚Äôs your fucking excuse?  Dressing well doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive.  You don‚Äôt have to shop at Nordstrom to get laid.   

-No wings?  Find some.

-Tinder girl not answering?  Forget her. 

-Girl you met in person not answering?  Next. 

-Approach anxiety?  How about dying a virgin?  Which is more scary?

-Nervous about rejection?  Make it a point tomorrow to go get rejected 20 times. ON PURPOSE.  At the end you‚Äôll realize it makes no fucking difference.  And you‚Äôll never have felt so confident in your life. (Plus you'll probably get some numbers along the way). 

When you‚Äôre done with all that, realize that everything on this list is within your control.  And it‚Äôs time to fix it.   

Even more important:  Fixing it.  Taking pride in yourself.  Being a man who gets his shit together.  That‚Äôs what girls really want anyway.

They don‚Äôt want dudes on the fuck-up list above who memorized some pick up lines. 

So stop asking about HER.  Start asking about YOU.  Once you do that, you‚Äôll discover that girls are really easy to find.  

Actually, they‚Äôll start finding you.

"So the story is: I recently got a final essay I wrote for my psci class flagged for plagiarism. The Turnitin report shows that the essay contained 13% content from internet sources. Taking out all the book quotations that I have cited properly, 7% is being matched with an article online. We were not to use any outside sources in the writing of this paper. Hence, I did not use anything except for my lecture notes and the book. 
 
Prior to the class midterm, I had read a lot of information about this topic online and made study notes. I wrote about the same topic in various course elements including the midterm, assignments, and notes. While writing my paper, I came across the same ideas and thoughts wrote these two lines that got matched with that article online.
 
In the past, I was in the Science faculty and there was a group project where someone in my group copied and pasted information in their section. We as a group, got a 5% deduction off the report and got put on academic probation. That guy in our group had to take two ethics courses in addition to this penalty. Since we were in first year at that time, we did not consider appeal procedures and simply took the deduction because we were scared and unaware. Now, this makes it my second offence and the penalties are much stricter (involving suspension and deduction from course grades). 
 
I spoke to the Faculty Associate Dean, and provided him with all my lecture notes and rough drafts that I used to write my paper. I also told him that in the writing of the paper, I consulted the professor multiple times for feedback on my thesis and my essay outline. The Dean drew the conclusion that since I asked for feedback, it shows that I was ‚Äòstruggling‚Äô with the essay and finally resorted to outside sources for my paper. 
 
I chose to do a significantly difficult essay topic in the first place because it really interested me and I felt confident talking about it. There is no reason for me to write the entire essay on my own, and copy a few lines at the end. I had started the essay well ahead of time and there was no pressure of finishing it either. 
 
However, the Dean‚Äôs decision was biased because of the fact that this is my second offence under the same policy. I also feel that not enough weight was given to my evidence because my notes clearly showed where I derived those sentences. In this decision, he is giving me a zero on the assignment, further 10% off the final course grade, and suspension for two terms. I have no choice but to appeal this decision. How should I go about writing my appeal, I have no other physical evidence than the rough drafts I already provided to the dean. 
Let me know what I should consider doing in this situation.",11,1527831738.0,8nmde0,45,[Serious] Need help appealing Dean's decision,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/8nmde0/serious_need_help_appealing_deans_decision/,2018-06-01 01:42:18
"Two men cry out in a forgotten age. The roar of the slayer harmonises with the scream of the slain. In this earliest epoch, when humankind still fears spirits of fire and prays to false gods for the sun to rise, the murder of a brother is the darkest of deeds.


Blood marks the man‚Äôs face, just as it marks the spear in his clenched fists and the rocks beneath his brother‚Äôs body. The wound gouts and sprays ‚Äì the man tastes the red wine of his brother‚Äôs veins, feeling the blood‚Äôs heat where it lands on his bearded skin, tasting of metals yet undiscovered and seas yet
unseen. As the hot salt of spilt life burns his tongue, the man knows with impossible clarity: He is the first.


Mankind ‚Äì in all its myriad forms on the thousandfold path from wretched lizard-thing to warm-blooded mammal ‚Äì has always fought to survive. Even as hunched ape-creatures and brutish proto-men, it waged insignificant and miserable wars upon itself with fists and teeth and rocks.


Yet this man is the first. Not the first to hate, nor even the first to kill. He is the first to take life in cold blood. He is the first to murder.


His dying brother‚Äôs thrashing hand reaches for him, raking dirty nails across his sweating skin. Seeking mercy or vengeance? The man doesn‚Äôt know, and in his rage he doesn‚Äôt care. He drives the wooden spear deeper into the yielding hardness of meat and against the scrape of bone. Still he screams, still he roars.
The scream of the first murderer cuts through the veil, echoing across reality and unreality alike. To the things that wait in the warp, mankind will never sing a sweeter song.


Behind the veil, the scream takes a carnival of forms, riotous and infinite in variety. The frail laws of physics that so coldly govern the material universe have no power ‚Äì here, those binding codes fracture into their separate fictions. Here, time itself goes to die.


On and on it plunges, crashing and dissolving and reforming in the endless storm. It ruptures a cloudburst of other screams that haven‚Äôt yet been cried aloud. It punctures the fire-flesh of shrieking ghosts, adding to the torment of those lost and forsaken souls. It knifes through a disease that was rendered extinct
by man-made cures twenty-six thousand years before.


And on. And on. And on. Clashing with moments that haven‚Äôt yet happened, that won‚Äôt happen for half an eternity. Grinding against events that took place back when the earliest Terran creatures exhaled water and ‚Äì for the very first time ‚Äì raked in lungfuls of air.


Behind the veil, there is no when and then. Everything is now. Always and eternally now, in the shifting tides of an infinite malignance.


Lights shine in that malignant black: the lights of sentience that draw the darkness closer. The same lights flare and shriek and dissolve at the merest touch from the forces around them. Dreams and memories take shape only to shatter amidst the claws and jaws manifesting within the nothingness.


The scream plunges on through every whisper of hatred that will ever be spoken by a human mouth or thought by a human mind. It cracks like lightning above the sky of a dying civilisation that will expire before ever grasping the wonder of space flight. It breaks the stone city-bones of a culture gone to dust thousands of years ago.


From its genesis in breath and sound the scream becomes acidic nothingness, then fury and fire. It becomes a memory that burns, a whisper that rends and a prophecy that bleeds. 


And it becomes a name. A name that means nothing in any language spoken by any species, living or dead. A name that carries meaning only in the strangled, misfiring thoughts of humans breathing their last breaths, in that precious and terrifying moment when their spirits are caught between one realm and the
next.


The name of a creature, a daemon born from the cold rage of one traitorous soul in one treacherous second. Its name is the deed itself, the first murder and the death rattle that followed. In the creature‚Äôs shrieking journey across the warp, it touches the minds of every human who ever was and will ever be, from the long dead to those yet to be born. The daemon is tied to the species with such primal intimacy that every man, woman and child knows its caress ‚Äì deep in their blood and bones ‚Äì even if they know nothing of its name.


Billions of them stir in their sleep across the many ages of man, writhing against the unwanted touch of the creature‚Äôs birth back in the mists of time.


Millions of them wake, staring into the darkness of mud huts, palatial bedchambers, housing complexes and any one of the countless other structures that humans build for themselves across a million worlds and thousands of years",24,1527819447.0,8nkpt7,77,[Book Excerpt| Master of Mankind] Abel fucks humanity up forever more.,https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/8nkpt7/book_excerpt_master_of_mankind_abel_fucks/,2018-05-31 22:17:27

Behind the veil, the scream takes a carnival of forms, riotous and infinite in variety. The frail laws of physics that so coldly govern the material universe have no power ‚Äì here, those binding codes fracture into their separate fictions. Here, time itself goes to die.


On and on it plunges, crashing and dissolving and reforming in the endless storm. It ruptures a cloudburst of other screams that haven‚Äôt yet been cried aloud. It punctures the fire-flesh of shrieking ghosts, adding to the torment of those lost and forsaken souls. It knifes through a disease that was rendered extinct
by man-made cures twenty-six thousand years before.


And on. And on. And on. Clashing with moments that haven‚Äôt yet happened, that won‚Äôt happen for half an eternity. Grinding against events that took place back when the earliest Terran creatures exhaled water and ‚Äì for the very first time ‚Äì raked in lungfuls of air.


Behind the veil, there is no when and then. Everything is now. Always and eternally now, in the shifting tides of an infinite malignance.


Lights shine in that malignant black: the lights of sentience that draw the darkness closer. The same lights flare and shriek and dissolve at the merest touch from the forces around them. Dreams and memories take shape only to shatter amidst the claws and jaws manifesting within the nothingness.


The scream plunges on through every whisper of hatred that will ever be spoken by a human mouth or thought by a human mind. It cracks like lightning above the sky of a dying civilisation that will expire before ever grasping the wonder of space flight. It breaks the stone city-bones of a culture gone to dust thousands of years ago.


From its genesis in breath and sound the scream becomes acidic nothingness, then fury and fire. It becomes a memory that burns, a whisper that rends and a prophecy that bleeds. 


And it becomes a name. A name that means nothing in any language spoken by any species, living or dead. A name that carries meaning only in the strangled, misfiring thoughts of humans breathing their last breaths, in that precious and terrifying moment when their spirits are caught between one realm and the
next.


The name of a creature, a daemon born from the cold rage of one traitorous soul in one treacherous second. Its name is the deed itself, the first murder and the death rattle that followed. In the creature‚Äôs shrieking journey across the warp, it touches the minds of every human who ever was and will ever be, from the long dead to those yet to be born. The daemon is tied to the species with such primal intimacy that every man, woman and child knows its caress ‚Äì deep in their blood and bones ‚Äì even if they know nothing of its name.


Billions of them stir in their sleep across the many ages of man, writhing against the unwanted touch of the creature‚Äôs birth back in the mists of time.


Millions of them wake, staring into the darkness of mud huts, palatial bedchambers, housing complexes and any one of the countless other structures that humans build for themselves across a million worlds and thousands of years",24,1527819447.0,8nkpt7,75,[Book Excerpt| Master of Mankind] Abel fucks humanity up forever more.,https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/8nkpt7/book_excerpt_master_of_mankind_abel_fucks/,2018-05-31 22:17:27

"Had to share this with our sub because it has had me laughing all morning.

So the guy that works across the hall from me \(teacher\) is a HUGE Pens fan. He is the biggest homer I have ever met in my life. The Penguins can literally do no wrong in his eyes, they are the greatest team every season, when they lose it's because of 10 thousand different excuses. After the Wilson hit against Aston\-Reese, the next morning I didn't even have my door unlocked until he came flying out of his room to tell me how much of a cheap shot that was and how he ""deserves to be kicked out of the league."" He's a piece of work. After beating the Pens he came in and blamed alllll this different shit for it, mostly stating, ""We can't win the cup every year because it would get boring.""

Today...

I don't see him in the morning. He catches me in the hallway during my Prep period an hour or so ago. This was what he starts with:

""Ok, I'm just gonna say this. The Holtby save last night. Like, I get that everyone is flipping out about it, but I honestly don't see the big deal? Like, he didn't even track the puck, he just kind of flopped backwards and the puck found his stick. The stick is like, 6 to 8 inches and the puck just went right into it. Holtby didn't really make a great save, he just got super lucky flopping backwards. Like, it wasn't a great goalie save or great skill. For example, in game 7 a couple season ago when we won the Cup, Fleury made an incredible save. He actually tracked the puck across the ice and then made the save. That was way better, I think, then just throwing your stick out and praying it hits it. Like, there is just no skill in throwing your stick down. It's not like he tracked the puck and got in position, he just kind of assumed and prayed.""

I was bit late to the party on the ""best advice you've been given"" thread, but I don't want anyone to miss out on this video from Steve Atlas. 

In the video he talks about unseen progress and how he's seen, time after time, people giving up miles before they begin to scratch the surface of their potential with training.

I think the advice in this video is particularly relevent to everyone here as what we do is completely non linear in terms of progression.

My personal experience of this is with handbalance, I spent months trying to decide which wall to throw my head against when I failled to kick up for the 20th time in the row. Then one day out of nowhere I discovered the sweet spot and I'm getting consistent holds. I can't count the amount of times that I was in the car home from the gym thinking powerlifting starts Monday, fuck this shit.

"This was a few years ago and the details are a bit fuzzy but the main points I remember. I was only 20, but had just bought my first house and needed furniture, for the entire house. I went to buy a shit ton of furniture for the mostly empty house.  I‚Äôm not big on shopping so I choose a place close by and was going to buy everything possible from one place.

The first store had two employees and they ignored me, one being the manager.  Honestly I would rather browse in peace and while I couldn‚Äôt hear what they were saying, I got the feeling they thought I was just looking around and probably had no money being so young. I finally walked over to the manager and he seemed a little annoyed. I noticed his name tag and it was the same as the store, so the owner turns out. I was the only customer in the place, what an idiot.

He quotes me a price on a piece of furniture and it was expensive but in my budget. He then made a snarky comment, something along the lines of betting I wished I could get furniture like that. 

I was already well on my way to quietly leaving his rude ass store, and going to my second choice, a store across town. Screw being quiet. I told him I had just bought a house and was there to buy furniture to fill that house today. His demeanor perked up and was suddenly very interested in me. 

I told him I hadn‚Äôt appreciated being ignored and that I knew why he hadn‚Äôt bothered to even say hello to me. 

I asked him for directions to his competitor. He was apologetic as I walked out, knowing he‚Äôd missed out on several thousands of dollars in sales.

Edit: A few comments were made about me being a young home owner. I was equally surprised I was approved as well. It is ironic this is a story about a guy ignoring me because he thought I was to young to have money, and some of the comments doubting I was a 20 year old home owner.

"I can watch The Sopranos over and over and it's still entertaining.  Other shows...not so much.  I loved Breaking Bad, but after one viewing, that's it.  Better Call Saul?  Same.  Boardwalk Empire?  Once was enough.  So, what is it about The Sopranos that sets it apart from other shows?  Why does it remain relevant?

I think that it's because it isn't just about things that happen to people, but it's about people who have things happen to them.  Classic literature was frequently about the shared human experience, and character development was the focus.  Modern literature and entertainment is about the story.  The people are only important as far as they advance the action.  The Sopranos was primarily about...well, the Sopranos.  It was about how they reacted, developed, or disintegrated in the face of a variety of circumstances.

Sometimes those circumstances were mundane events, like ones we all face.  Others were beyond most people's scope of experience.  What do you do when your kids disappoint you?  How do you react to getting pulled over for speeding?  How do you handle getting shot?  What do you say to your mom after discovering her plot to have you killed?  What suit do you wear to your wife's cousin's funeral?  Does the fact that you killed him affect which tie you wear?

Those other shows hinge on suspense and action.  The characters simply aren't that compelling.  At least, that's what I think is\-\-in part\-\-what separates The Sopranos from other shows.",86,1527822542.0,8nl52u,61,Why is The Sopranos so much better than just about every other show?,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesopranos/comments/8nl52u/why_is_the_sopranos_so_much_better_than_just/,2018-05-31 23:09:02
"Just a basic text post here of a helpful integration for my toddler's room-

My child likes to wake up absurdly early. Neither my wife nor I do. Obviously toddler typically wins each morning, dragging us out of bed groggy and miserable. 

We were looking at solutions such as ""Green means Go"" alarm clock, and others which would show a red light until it was time for the child to wake up and get out of bed - but some of these were pricey, or limited in the ability to be programmed for different days/times (weekend vs weekday)

Instead we use any old connected RGB light (in my case, I use Zigbee RGB LED strips I placed in the kids lamp)

At 530am the light slowly comes on red, and at 630am weekdays, and 730am weekends, it switches to green. 

We've taught the kid that when the light is red, she should stay in her bed, or can play quietly in her room; and only when the light is green should she come get mommy and daddy. Bathroom needs are the exception. 

So far (2 months in), it's working amazingly well. 
She will wake up, and either lounge around in bed, or play in her room until the light turns green - and every time at exactly that time we'll hear the pitter patter of her little feet running towards our room to get us up. 

The extra sleep helps us, and the kid has an understanding of when to start her day.

"I should preface this by saying that I'm not into masochistic games by any means. I play games for fun. If I start something that seems like it's going to be extremely punishing, I'll stop and play something that lets me win more than once in a while.

I tried the original version of Dark Souls a couple of years ago (due to a post recommending it as a PC alternative to Monster Hunter) but I just couldn't get into it because of what I said in the preceding paragraph. I had to grind, I kept dying, and there was no way I was getting past the Taurus Demon. 

Because I'd heard so much in the following years about how great this game was, I decided to buy the remastered version and beat it. (Spoilers: I haven't beaten it.) Since making that decision and pouring some hours into the game, I've beaten the Taurus Demon and made my way through a big part of the Undead Parish.

When I faced the Taurus Demon again, my heart was fucking racing. I wanted to beat it, but I wanted to be smarter about it this time. Whether I actually did employ smarter tactics or not, I beat it after two tries. After the battle, I could still hear my heart firing on all cylinders - however, a kind of peace washed over me. I'd done it: the monster that had haunted me from the back of my mind the entire time was dead. 

I could finally move forward.

I've read about Dark Souls helping people deal with depression in the past but I didn't understand why. Now I think I maybe do. It's about taking things piece by piece, one step at a time, to make progress. Every victory feels monumental. The game does not move quickly (at least not for me) and it's akin to bettering one's self or overcoming challenges. Whether it's dealing with an illness or overcoming a loss or getting in shape: to move forward, you first need to be ready and take one step at a time... just like in the game.

"So this just happened to me last night. This is a cautionary tale about letting good and evil characters be in the same party and taking chaos gaming and power gaming too far. If you see a similar story pop up on one of the other RPG subreddits then it's my DM who wasn't the bad guy of this story. So first, a bit of background. This was the first D&D campaign I'd ever been in. We'd been playing this game for 2 and a half years and I was the first player to join the game back in session one. Everyone else trickled in as the game went on. With that out of the way, let's introduce the party.

Cromwell- My character. A human ranger. As a character he's basically Aragorbi-Wan Kenobi. He's the most rangery ranger that's ever rangered. Neutral good

Mat- a kobold monk. His player had frequently switched characters throughout the campaign. Lawful Evil.

Kultarrean- a half elf bard. Claimed to be chaotic good but had previously blown up a magic shop because the owner wouldn't lower the price of a very rare magic item. Also had recently taken control of a legion of Drow. 

Piper- Halfling rogue. He had played in the game almost as long as I had. Our characters were close friends with each other. Chaotic good.

Bahrus- dragonborn paladin. Had previously admitted to being a ""shitty paladin"" after he chose to cut out an organ in his body rather than give up his hammer to his god in exchange for an artifact weapon. Lawful good I think.

The story picks up with our rag-tag group of level 20 adventurers with 2 artifact weapons gearing up to fight our world's version of Tiamat. We were also accompanied by Kultarrean's Drow and all but one of Mat's previous characters. We march our asses right up to Tiamat and then everything falls off the rails. Firstly, Bahrus kneels and offers his loyalty to Tiamat. Then Mat pledges his loyalty. Then Kultarrean pledges hers. At this point I'm upset both in and out of game. In game my character had fought against them tyrannical rule of his own father at one point in his life and wasn't about to let another tyrant live. Out of game, I was pissed that the grand finale to a game I'd been heavily invested in for almost 3 years was ending with half of the party turning on the other half for seemingly no good reason instead of having us wage epic battle with a seemingly unstoppable force. In game, my character pulled his swords, stood in the middle of the group and said ""Will you fight me one at a time or all at once?"" Thankfully my trusted friend Piper then pulled off a surprise attack on Bahrus and declared his loyalty to me. Additionally, two of Mat's former characters sided with me which led to a situation where one player entered a combat with himself (which we called PvMe). The revelations and betrayals weren't done yet though. During the combat, Bahrus revealed that his plan was to fake turning on us and backstab Tiamat. The problem was that he hadn't told anyone of this plan in or out of game and had broken his oath as a result. He also lost his artifact when he broke his oath. Kultarrean disengaged from combat and revealed to us that she had become a lich and her disguise was so good that it fooled all of us. Her alignment had changed to evil when she took over the Drow too. My group ended up killing the traitors and one of Mat's old characters, a wizard, used wish to transport us and all of the innocent people in danger of being enslaved by Tiamat to another planet to start life over. In the end our characters got to have good endings but I can't help but be upset by the way things went. I don't know if I'm overreacting but this seems like some truly awful role-playing and chaos/power gaming from some of the PCs. We were fully capable of winning against Tiamat and it pisses me off that we didn't get to do it. The DM offered to let us do that fight as a one-shot later but it feels to me like the moment is gone. If any of the players are reading this, I love you guys to death but seriously? This was how you wanted to end the game? 

Edit 1: One small detail that I forgot to mention was that due to the choices we made with our stats and characters, Piper and Cromwell were consistently dealing more damage than everyone else in the party... And they decided to fight it out with us anyway",18,1527814418.0,8nk0iy,90,The epic climax of an almost 3 year campaign turns into an epic clusterfuck of betrayals,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpghorrorstories/comments/8nk0iy/the_epic_climax_of_an_almost_3_year_campaign/,2018-05-31 20:53:38

"MHA 185: Wing Hero Hawks.

The President of the Hero Association says it's a critical juncture now that it's been approximately 3 months since All Might retired, and thus they lack an icon of peace, which is why they're gathered here now to nominate one.  While the president is talking, Hawks asks Endeavor secretly how it feels to be #1 and Endeavor just glares at him.

They turn the table over to the heroes for comments, and Ryukyu says she wants  to withdraw from the list because she was unable to save someone and thus feels like someone who is more suited should be up here rather than her.

Kamui has made a team with Edgeshot and intends to continue working as usual, and another hero, Crust laments not being at Kamino that day. Milco warns anyone plotting evil that she's coming for 'em.

Hawks however is like ""Does anyone really wanna hear *talk* about peace and justice?"" He basically talks about how those who weren't around to make results and thus lost standings shouldn't be talking big.

Hawks is 22 years old, and broke into the charts on the top three, and at 18 was already in the top ten --heck at that age he had already started an office of his own.  He's the fastest/youngest hero to break into the top ten --he's even known as ""the guy who went too far too fast.""

Hawks hands the mic to Endeavor who tries to think of a reason to inspire youth to seek strength, but in the end keeps it simple ""Just watch me."" After it's all said and done, Endeavor is pissed at Hawks who says he just wanted to stir things up and provide a bit of impact.

Hawks says he wasn't really an All Might fan or anything, but he was surprised to see that he retired when he did, and he does think that having a symbol of justice is important so they do need a new leader.

He proposes he and Endeavor team up as he's having issues with Nomu in his home area.  Meanwhile someone says they have expectations for a new ""High end"" and a completely black creature with garbled speech says to leave things to it. Seems like it's an evolved Nomu.

Next Issue, My Hero Academia getting the cover and lead color page for the ""Pro Hero arc"".

"I work in a corporate veterinary clinic and I just began my career with them about three months ago. This week I began performing surgical procedures, such as mass removals and dental scaling/extractions to prove that I can authentically perform and monitor anesthesia independently. 

Since I'm still new, I am reserved in my dosage opinions because I don't want to come off as a know it all brat. I still have a lot to learn, so opinions of coworkers/doctors matter.

Today I began a dental extraction and scaling on a 25 pound Beagle, the canines maximum Propofol ( sleepy anesthesia drug for those who aren't in the field, it looks like opaque milk ) was 9 mL. The observing technician told me to only give 5 mL which I honestly thought was a bit low/inadequate since Propofol is only truly effective for 15 to 20 minutes - this dog was also a drama queen that screamed if you so much as picked her up, so I worried about her being 'finicky' while under. Still, since I was new I didn't say anything and silently nodded.

I began the procedure and started the dog at 3 Sevoflurane ( sleepy gas ), but the tech observing me turned it down to 2. A bit light for my liking, especially since she had a healthy blood pressure and heart rate; I had her on a good fluid rate so I wasn't worried about her pulse/pressures falling whatsoever. Yet again I stayed silent - I'm new, I'll keep it to myself for now.

Fifteen minutes into the procedure, I'm scaling a carnassial molar ( feel free to google a dog dental chart - carnassial's are those big ass mofo molars with 3 peaks ) and prodding around for pockets. Suddenly, the dog lightly licks my finger and shudders- a silent warning to get your hand out of the mouth asap-- but before I can pull my hand away, she clamps down with ALL her force ( anesthesia = no muscle control, using full strength is common ) and both her carnassials on the top and bottom completely go through my index- clicking together audibly while under my skin. Absolute agony, you wouldn't think a 25 lb. dog can inflict so much pressure and pain - you don't know what a dog bite is til they've actually used the full force of their jaw. I'd been lucky through my internships and had never been injured.

I get my hand out after having to force her jaw open with the help of the other technician, there's blood everywhere - gushing out like a glorious fountain of thick, syrupy Koolaid. It was quite glorious, I'm not going to lie. 

I ended up having to go to the hospital - stitches, tetanus shot, rabies for precaution ( whatever. Dog was up to date ), the doctor ordered some heavy duty antibiotics since the dog had severe periodontal disease and sank its tartar coated, grimy teeth into the deepest recesses of my flesh. Now I can't perform surgery for two weeks til my hand is better.

I could have avoided this whole situation if I'd spoken up about my own dosage preferences, but I didn't want to look condescending and aloof to senior staff. Thanks to my precautionary attitude, I'm dealing with a severe dog bite on my dominant hand. One of those days where you kick yourself. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. 

TL;DR: My coworker didn't let me control my anesthesia dosages and I ended up having to go to the hospital because the dog clamped into my hand while I was performing a dental procedure. I had to get sutured up, my fingers and part of my hand are fucked, and I can't perform surgery for two weeks, possibly longer if it becomes infected. My desire to be polite since I'm new to the hospital completely fucked me over today, fortunately worker's comp covers my lost wages and hospital bills, which I'm grateful for. Rip my hand though.

"Consider this my ‚ÄúRider of Rohan‚Äù speech. Sorry it‚Äôs so long.

I first saw Star Wars in 1986 when I was four years old.  My parents had to go out of town, so my grandparents were in charge of watching my sister and me.  Before my parents left, my grandmother asked my mom if I was allowed to watch Star Wars.  My mom was hesitant, because she was afraid it might be too violent for me, and answered, ‚Äúno.‚Äù  My grandmother let me watch it anyway.  That‚Äôs what grandparents do.  The blue glow of ‚ÄúA long time ago in a galaxy far, far away‚Ä¶.‚Äù flashed on screen followed by the words ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù quickly fading into infinity. And I was hooked. And I became obsessed.  It became my favorite series of all time; the movies to which I compare all other movies. They still remain my favorite movies.  Not all childhood favorites are this way.  In fact, I would say, that most don‚Äôt age well.  Have you ever tried watching the original He-Man and the Masters of the Universe as an adult? Yikes. But not Star Wars. Star Wars is a Jack Daniels that aged into a Pappy Van Winkle.

When I hear that Disney bought Lucasfilm in 2012, I was stoked. I had been a child of the Expanded Universe, but for some reason that was never canon for me. It was never Gospel.  I never thoughts I would see my heroes on the silver screen again, so I was just happy I was getting new Star Wars movies.

In my opinion, I have enjoyed the four Disney movies (and one television series). I realize that they are flawed, like most things are, but (again) I‚Äôm just happy that I‚Äôm getting new Star Wars.  It is ok that I like the new Star Wars movies. It is also ok for you not to like them. Most of the criticisms against these movies are valid. After all, art is subjective. I get that.

It pains me that the fan base is at a divided.  That we can‚Äôt have a civil discussion without name calling or telling people they are wrong. But, hey, it‚Äôs the internet. It also pains me that there is a boycott on the Solo movie. Again, I realize that some have a different opinion then me, and that‚Äôs ok. I know that some are angry with Kathleen Kennedy, Rian Johnson, and the direction that Lucasfilm is taking Star Wars, but is boycotting the way to go? What is this meant to accomplish? Isn‚Äôt this just hurting that franchise that you, and I, love?

It has been no secret that Solo has been suffering at the box office. As of now, it is predicted to make less than $250,000,000. Part of this could be to movie competition, part of this could be to the backlash of The Last Jedi, and/or part of this could be from the boycott. I want to see Solo succeed, and I bet many of you do too. I have seen many people say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame that the movie is doing so poorly. It was really good/fun.‚Äù So, here‚Äôs my charge for you: instead of #BoycottSolo, I say you #SeeSolo. See the movie.  Not just once, but again and again (if you are financially able to). Let‚Äôs rally and pull our beloved franchise from the ashes so that it can surpass $250,000,000. Let‚Äôs see Star Wars succeed. By doing so, we won‚Äôt have to worry about Lucasfilm pulling the plug on various movies in the Star Wars universe.  So, who‚Äôs with me? #SeeSolo",113,1527805648.0,8niu42,136,Save Solo.

"So I've been poking my head in some of the local Toys R Us that are liquidating. I noticed they were also selling equipment and fixtures.. so I asked about their IT equipment.

The store by me has...

* Dell R330 - $800 each (two)
* Cisco 3560 - $40 each (two)
* 1000VA APC UPSes - $50 each (three)
* Patch panels and tons of cables - $200 


I checked the dates on the UPSes, and the ones by me were replaced about 3 months ago - so they are fairly new. 

I'm thinking about going for the R330's, the shelves they sit on, and the UPSes - but the prices I'm seeing for these online are all over the place.

I'm also not 100% sure on the specs.. and given its a liquidation, not sure how much information I can grab around the specs for the machines.

He stepped into the light.

Outside a computer monitor, he looked worse. Tired eyes, ringed with dark circles; greasy hair falling across his forehead. And he wore a smirk that sent chills down my spine.

Jingwen drew her gun. ‚ÄúHands in the air,‚Äù she said, with forced calm.

He didn‚Äôt reply, and took a step forward.

‚ÄúHands in the air! I‚Äôll shoot!‚Äù

‚ÄúGo ahead.‚Äù

Her hands shook.

And then she pulled the trigger.

*Bang!*

For a second, time stood still. The light above our head flickered, and everyone was frozen in the gray shadows of dawn. Blondie‚Äôs face, contorted in a sob. Jingwen‚Äôs mouth stretched in a gasp. His casual grin, as if laughing at a joke.

*Ping.*

The bullet bounced off his jacket, onto the floor ‚Äì

Now no larger than a grain of sand.

Jingwen‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúHow ‚Äì that‚Äôs not possible ‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all skeptics at first,‚Äù he said, picking a figurine off the nightstand. ‚ÄúBut sooner or later, you come to believe.‚Äù

*Believe what? That he‚Äôs‚Ä¶ turning people into those?* I glanced at the figurine in his hand, to the one clenched in Blondie‚Äôs fist. Both were clearly plastic‚Ä¶ just *toys‚Ä¶*

*But if it isn‚Äôt true‚Ä¶ how do I explain the bullet?*

*Or the fact that everyone on floor 4 disappear?*

I shook my head. *It doesn‚Äôt matter what he‚Äôs thinks he‚Äôs doing. Just distract him as much as you can.* I took a few steps back, towards the window. ‚ÄúOkay, say I believe everything. But why, then? Why are you doing this?‚Äù

‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt you heard?‚Äù he said, his smile turning into a determined frown. ‚ÄúThe Time is Nigh.‚Äù With his index finger, he pointed to the sky.

‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù I asked. My fingers fell into the groove beneath the panes; I pressed upwards, and felt the window shift slightly.

‚ÄúThere is a Better Way.‚Äù Now he broke into a grin, and looked down at the figurines that scattered the floor with newfound affection. ‚ÄúThe Day of Reckoning is almost here, and I have done *far* more than my duty. They‚Äôre going to be so pleased.‚Äù

*Okay. He‚Äôs insane‚Ä¶ I have no idea what to say to that‚Ä¶ no idea‚Ä¶* ‚ÄúHey, she kept her end of the deal,‚Äù I said, motioning to Blondie with one hand, while the other stayed on the window. *Just a little more force, and I could get it open‚Ä¶*

He scoffed. ‚ÄúWhat do you care?‚Äù

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you keep your end?‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh, sure. Sounds fair to me.‚Äù He walked over to her, eyes glinting with amusement. Blondie unfurled her fingers, revealing the figurine in her palm, her eyes glinting with hope. He yanked it from her and held it up to his eyes.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a pretty one.‚Äù

Then he threw it to the ground, lifted his foot ‚Äì

And brought it down.

*Snap.*

Blondie screamed. A horrible, wounded scream that faded into convulsing sobs.

‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve known better than to bargain with one of us,‚Äù he yelled at her. ‚ÄúWe never compromise. The Better Way is the *right* way; there is no middle ground.‚Äù

She paused.

And then, with a wild scream, she flew at him. Her arms locked around his neck, and they fell to the ground in a tangled heap.

*Click.*

I yanked the window up.

‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù I yelled, diving through the window. *Follow me, Jingwen, please‚Ä¶*

I hit the damp soil with a thud. Pain shot through the left side of my body; but I picked myself up off the ground. I turned around, heart racing ‚Äì

*No. She wasn‚Äôt following.*

The little yellow light in the window flickered.

*No no no ‚Äì*

*Thump!*

Jingwen flew out of the window. ‚ÄúRun!‚Äù she screamed. We jumped in the car, breathless and pained. She jammed the keys into the ignition just as a dark shape ‚Äì a flash of black leather ‚Äì fell from the window.

The car screeched away. We flew down the road, the gravel crunching underneath the wheels.

\-\-\-

Nobody believed our story, of course. At least, not our *version* of the story. They believed that some weirdo with figurines was trying to lure people into his house ‚Äì just not the rest. Jingwen was promptly fired from the police force, both for inventing tall tales and for bringing a civilian along with her to a dangerous situation.

They sent more cops over to the house. By the time they got there, it was completely cleared out ‚Äì even the figurines were gone. I quit my job at the hotel and moved halfway across the country, where I became a barista. Not quite as good a job, but at least it came with discounted coffee instead of nighttime weirdos.

It was around closing time after a week on the job that the couple came in. A woman wearing glasses and a bun, followed by a blond guy. I served them up two coffees, and set out to wiping down some of the tables.

In the empty coffee shop, I couldn‚Äôt help but overhear their conversation, as it echoed off the tile.

‚ÄúLike I said in the email ‚Äì I have a problem,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou see, I ‚Äì I live with my parents. But they nag me *all* the time ‚Äì stop playing video games, it‚Äôs too late to go out with your friends, all of that. But I don‚Äôt have the money to move out. I have nowhere to go.‚Äù

She nodded, and looked at him with a small smile. ‚ÄúThere is a Better Way,‚Äù she said.

I dropped the rag.

‚ÄúWe will take care of your parents,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd then we will take care of you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait ‚Äì *take care of them?* What do you mean?‚Äù He started to look nervous; his eyes darted around the shop. ‚ÄúAll I need is a little money to move out. Uh, I thought ‚Äì I thought you came here to give me that.‚Äù

The woman shook her head, then pointed up. ‚ÄúThe Time is Nigh,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd you have come to me not a moment too soon.‚Äù

We both stared at her.

‚ÄúThe Day of Reckoning is almost upon us.‚Äù ",14,1527816420.0,8nkajt,233,"I work at a hotel. Last night, everyone on floor 4 disappeared. [Part 3] Final",https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8nkajt/i_work_at_a_hotel_last_night_everyone_on_floor_4/,2018-05-31 21:27:00

"Thought this might be useful for some on here.


In the process of buying a small house. House is about 140years old in a council conservation area.


Viewing: Was shown around by an agent who was new to the area. So basically didn't believe anything he said about the area. I knew more than him as I currently live in a flat close to the house I am buying.


Mortgage advisor: I met the agent's advisor and he was surprisingly very helpful and came up with mortgage products that I couldn't find myself or from the other advisor I had met. But I don't think a local advisor is required. If there is an online advisor who gives you cashback (using quidco or such) with similar mortgage products, I would go for it.


Second viewing: Following week - took longer. Around half an hour. Tried all taps/lights/doors/windows. Video+pictures. 


Offer: Called agent who stopped me before I made offer and told me that the house had had an insurance claim due to subsidence in 2012. Didn't make an offer as I wanted to reconsider. Offer was going to be for asking price.


Reflection period: Got all claim documents and certificate of stability from insurer. Got a quote to continue cover with same insurer who was willing to cover with me as new owner. Spoke to friends and colleagues and all forums including here. On balance, decided to make lower offer at 4% below asking.


Rejection: Offer was too low, got rejected. Negotiated again and went higher (2% below asking) and got accepted - subject to survey.


Mortgage: The rep of the lender came to the house and inspected it as part of their valuation. This was free. They valued it at asking price.


Appointed Solicitor: I recommend a local solicitor with a good reputation even if they are slightly expensive.


Survey: I recommend a local company for survey. And have a good chat with the surveyor after they release the survey report to you.


Price Negotiation: The survey recommended a few things to be fixed in the house and the vendor got 3 of the pieces of work done (total amount was about ¬£1,000) and for the roof work (quoted at about ¬£6,000), they said they will not be able to get it done. So I negotiated a price reduction to the purchase price.


Exchange: Make sure all the works are completed, invoices and documentation supplied before exchange of contracts. Do not budge on this. Your solicitor should strongly recommend this as well. They weren't prepared to do the exchange even if I once said let's go for it.


Completion: This has still not happened. Hopefully it will go smoothly. Will update later.


TL;DR
These are the steps I took as first time buyer. Get local surveyor and solicitor. I wouldn't be so specific on a local mortgage advisor, not even sure if they are totally necessary for a 'normal' purchase. Negotiate shrewdly based on survey report. Make sure all outstanding is complete before exchange.",18,1527816689.0,8nkbvh,72,[Property] First Time Buyer - Recently exchanged - Here are my learnings,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/8nkbvh/property_first_time_buyer_recently_exchanged_here/,2018-05-31 21:31:29

A few weeks ago we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8a48uv/moderators_try_marking_posts_as_oc_on_the_redesign/) \[[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8a48uv/moderators_try_marking_posts_as_oc_on_the_redesign/)\] \[[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/8b2t8f/do_you_have_a_community_built_around_oc/)\] support for a new OC tag in [r/redesign](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8a48uv/moderators_try_marking_posts_as_oc_on_the_redesign/) and [r/modnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/8b2t8f/do_you_have_a_community_built_around_oc/). Today, we‚Äôre opening the beta to allow more communities to try out the OC tag. We‚Äôd like to get more of your feedback on the feature.

**What updates have we made since the last post based on your feedback?**

* Moderators now have the ability to enable OC tags via subreddit settings. This will allow posters to mark post as OC during post creation in the new desktop redesign \(by default, these settings are disabled\):

https://i.redd.it/az9jw4kn49111.png

* AutoModerator support to filter OC tags and mark posts as OC \([documentation](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/automoderator/full-documentation)\). For example, you can filter for posts marked as OC and assign specific flairs to the post.
* Moderator log support for OC tags, so you‚Äôll be able to see when other moderators mark/unmark OC tags
* Tooltips on the OC tag that explain what they are

**Why should you try out OC tags?**

* Users submitting post to your subreddit no longer need to add ‚Äú\[OC\]‚Äù to the title
* You can easily recognize OC posts and assign flairs and moderator actions
* Ability to add/remove OC tags from a post \(rather than needing to remove the post entirely because you can‚Äôt change the post title\)

I‚Äôll be hanging out in the comments to answer questions. Thanks!

Cheers!",63,1527828544.0,8nly9b,39,OC tagging for moderators,https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/8nly9b/oc_tagging_for_moderators/,2018-06-01 00:49:04

"Finally gave in and switched to sync after seeing that the most common fix for people's problems on r/redditmobile was to just use sync. I got sick of their blatant favoritism when it came to iOS, and how iOS bug reports and feature requests usually get staff responses while Android posts are ignored. Also how there are features of the iOS version that aren't available on the Android version, for whatever reason. Seeing the new version post pinned to the top of the sub for iOS and letting the Android new version post get buried was the icing on the cake. I'm done with that garbage.

Anyway, I decided to try this one out so I downloaded it. After getting the free version, I immediately fell in love, wow, so many features! Even an AMOLED dark mode! üòç I was a bit disappointed to see ads, even though I pay for Reddit Gold so I don't have to, but they aren't that intrusive and I understand, yall gotta make money... So I just bought the pro version :P

Now on to a couple gripes/feature requests. Take note that I'm new to this app so I'm still learning, so if I say something that is actually changeable, please let me know!

- How do I collapse a comment without holding down on it? In the official app (on iOS at least, it's not exsistant on Android) if you wanted to collapse a thread, you hold down on any comment in the thread, and it'll all collapse. If you wanted to collapse just one reply, you'd tap next to their name. Doesn't seem to be the case here? Just curious. 
- I'm not new to Android, but I've had my iPhone since the 6 came out, and for some reason there seems to be this common thing in iOS versions of apps VS Android ones; swiping to get into menus. I wish I could swipe right to get into the left menu when on my front page, it'd be MUCH easier than having to reach allllll the way up to the top left corner of my screen when I normally browse with one hand that's in the opposite corner. I have a Galaxy S9, this thing is long lol. And yes, I know I can swipe from the EDGE of the screen, but with the S9 and the infinity screen, my little baby hands barely reach the edge. 
- ~~Is there a way to put the titles of posts on the TOP? It's kind of annoying to have to swipe all the way to the bottom of a picture/video post just to see the title. And yes, I turned full pictures on, because I don't want to have to tap a picture if I don't need to. It also gets confusing if the post's picture has text in it, it can be hard to tell where the title is.~~ FIXED UGH THIS APP IS GREAT
- Autoplaying gifs? I understand that this feature is probably annoying to a lot of people, but like I said before, I don't want to NEED to push every single gif I pass by, they should just play. This is a feature of the official app I was very surprised to not see here. The official app also has the option to only autoplay gifs on wifi, which is extremely useful. No need to waste data.  
- I see that posts marked as read are greyed out. Cool. But is there a way to stop that from greying out pictures? I get that I've already seen it, but that doesn't mean I want a Grey ton over it. Is there a way to turn it off just for the pictures? I don't mind the text being Grey. 

And that's all I can think of for now. I hope the devs of this app care more about us than the official app devs. Thank you!",20,1527803110.0,8niis5,144,Finally gave in and switched.

"I see a lot of students who abandon basic positions \(mount, back, etc.\) because they simply don't have any success in those positions.

Instead of sitting down with each of you \(readers\) and picking out what you're doing wrong, here's a simple list of things you can do to fix your own game and have more success.

**Mount**

Everyone seems to get rolled when they're on top while attacking submissions when they're first starting. It happens. Not all of us are Roger Gracie. Instead, we abandon the position and attack from positions we feel more comfortable with \(usually side control or feet\). We love the points, but hate the submissions, right?

**Try this:**

Don't sit in over the hips. Either sit on their chest \(hard if they have sharp, strong elbows\), or sit on their lap. Yes, LAP.

Push yourself all the way down until you're literally sitting on their lap, flare your knees, and touch your feet together in the space between their feet and butt.

Sitting over the middle of their torso with no anchor is a recipe for disaster until you're firmly settled into a choke or other submission.

Either way, stay loose and get used to flowing with the bronco rather than squeezing so tight and getting tossed.

Stay low over his head so his legs can't catch you from behind.\*

**Back**

your seatbelt shouldn't cross his body like a real seatbelt, and if it does, adjust it. The seatbelt should cross his chest like a rear naked setup with your wrist directly under his chin and your other arm comes directly up to the shoulder where your top hand is patiently waiting for it. Once you've clasped hands \(however you feel is most comfortable\), give him a biiiiig hug and the pressure will force his hands out of the way for your arms.

There's obviously other ways of doing this, but this is not a ""do this way only"". Just a ""here's what's worked for me after 15 years. Maybe it will help you."" sorta thing.

Once you set your choking hand \(relatively close to where you want it\), leave it! Every time you adjust, your opponent is going to make space. Instead, use your bottom hand and take the slack out of the other lapel by pulling it down.

You can either adjust the first hand until you \(hopefully\) get it where you want it, or you can just set it and adjust the other collar to make it tight.

**Closed Gward**

We've all learned closed guard and submissions from there, but almost nobody plays closed guard anymore! smh

Start with your hand DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP AF in the collar. By that, I mean you should be gripping the tag behind his neck.

Next, keep your wrist straight. Don't bend your wrist to the smooth contours of their neck. Curl your wrist towards you and lock it up, Private!

Control the head with your elbow. Now that you're deep in the collar with a strong wrist, use your elbow to control where the head is.

Incorporate your legs. If they're pushing themselves up, and you're trying to pull them down, simply lift your legs \(like you're bringing your legs to your face\). Don't open your guard, btw.

Finally, control the elbows. If you're deep in the collar, you only have one hand free. So if they're digging their elbows into your legs, then use your free hand to pull it out and reset. If it's the opposite side, then let go of the collar or switch hands in the collar and use your other hand to free your leg. It's a game.

**One last note:** Open your guard ON YOUR TERMS. Not theirs. If you think they're about to open your guard, anticipate it and open it before and get position \(foot on hip or shoulder or whatever\). If you hang on for dear life and they pop your guard, you're already over\-committed, they'll capitalize, they'll pass.

That's all for now. I'll post more later...",36,1527820201.0,8nkthf,101,‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do anything from...‚Äù,https://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/8nkthf/i_cant_do_anything_from/,2018-05-31 22:30:01
"I‚Äôm posting this here because I think I have a serious problem, and wanted to know if anybody else is having the same ‚Äústruggle‚Äù. We have a work event tonight, our agency won a prize and we are all supposed to go to the award giving ceremony. Last night I spent an hour trying out outfits trying to decide what to wear, and I settled this morning for a knee length printed dress, with mid block heels and minimal make up. 

But as I was doing my commute to work, I remembered a dress that would‚Äôve been PERFECT instead of this one, a black sheath dress, perfect, understated. And now I‚Äôm having the biggest anxiety thinking I picked the wrong outfit, I almost got off the train to go back home and change. This has happened to me before, and it kinda ruins my day. I know, first world problems, and I come from the third world!. It doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm the designated fashionable person at the office and that somehow now I feel the pressure to be perfect at all times especially for a work event. 

I also feel the pressure to be professional with the right hint of sexy, and all these blurry lines that are so hard to decipher when dressing for work or work related environment. 

I have come to a point, where I think it has become an issue, I have the biggest anxiety now, and I can‚Äôt seem to snap out of this weird state of mind. 

Do any of you guys deal with this kind of anxiety? And if so how do you deal with this? How do you snap out of this? It seems so silly and I can‚Äôt convince myself to just stop thinking about it.

"Sometimes my players still surprise me.  A group of mostly neutral  characters was hired as guards for a traveling magical menagerie. One of the creatures was described to the audience as a rare wonder from the southern jungles. It was instead a celestial. Since the Oracle could understand celestial they agreed that freeing the celestial would earn them a boon. However she would slay everyone responsible for her imprisonment. Meaning her original captors who sold her and the ringleader.

When told what she was the leader was horrified that he had held such a being captive and went to free her, despite knowing what she would do. My party, **every character**, used their boon to have the celestial spare his life. She smiled pleased with them and flew off, leaving each with a feather.

I honestly did not see that comming. But the reasoning used by the non\-good characters was since they helped secure her freedom, they were responsible if she killed him.

"Hi guys. 

I kind of wanted to run a problem I'm having, by you all. It's been a bit of an issue and this is ongoing, so some advice would be welcomed. I have been going back and forth on whether I should say anything here, so I may end up deleting this at some point.

Ok, so I have been having a bit of a problem with one of the girls I'm at school (university) with. I met her first week of class (it's now end of semester) and the two of us, along with a few others, made fast friends. We were all lucky enough to be in a group project together and we all gelled prety well. This was pretty big for me, because it had been a very long time since I had made any new friends. I'm a recovering depressive, so my social circle kind of died off, so having friends was massive for me. Although it made me a little afraid to lose them.

So my issue started when I wasn't even there. I was late to a group meeting, where one of my other friends mentioned that she was going out with her boyfriend over the weekend and the other girl asked if she could come. They joked about her bringing me for a double date, which then childishly progressed to pretending we were married. I got there and was informed that we were fake married, had no idea what was going on and struggled to play along with it. I am really not comfortable with stuff like that, I never have been and it has been obvious enough that they have noticed (we have discussed it.) I have *kind of* learned how to play along since though, so things have been okay.

Over the last few days, it has become pretty clear that she is taking the game too far. She has become a bit posesive, very clingy and has been really getting up in my personal space. I had agreed to help her with a filming project she had, knowing that she needs all the help she can get (I think shes going to fail this semester) so I came along to be an actor (I got to be Sherlock, which I was into.) However after turning up to film, she changed the story (which I helped write BTW) into a 'love story' between Sherlock and Watson, who she had decided to play. So through the day, she had been trying to shoehorn in more 'romance' scenes where they didn't belong (Thank god my other friends were there to talk her down) and was insistant on a 'dip' scene. Where I had to wake her up and dip her. It was bad enough that on 'waking her up' she tried to kiss me, but she insisted on multiple takes of the 'dip' (even though we were running out of betteries on the camera.) That whole day was her making things uncomfortable, she was brushing shoulders, going for random hugs, at one point she just sat on my lap which was really awkward. The day after I had to go in to film more, while I was really unwell. I had her doing similar things, although this time she was annoyed at my lack of energy and was getting really cross that I wasn't really talking to her much. (I ended up passing out after I got home.) Now apparantly she wants to re-do the dip scene, and I feel like she is just playing out her own little fantasy with me and I just don't want to do it. There is no reason to redo it, the footage is fine. But she wants it in one shot. Am I being unfair here in not wanting to do that agian? Or should I honor the fact that I agreed to help?

But this whole joke has gone on too far and now I'm pretty convinced that shes taking it seriously. I'm not interested in her like that at all. She's not my type and she's so much younger that I am (She was *in* primary school the same year I started teaching in primary schools!) so there isn't anything there for me. I've tried to drop as much body language as I can, but it's just not happeing, she either is misreading it, not reading it, or not really caring. I've been pretty afraid to bring this up with her because I'm so afraid of loosing friends that I have been so happy to have made. 

I think this has given me a brand new appreciation for unwanted attention. Why not everyone who throws themselves at you are people you really want. I honestly don't think I really understood this untill now, which probably makes me sound a bit ignorant. Kind of makes me sad that dating just sucks for everyone.

But I'm really unsure of how to go about this. On some level I feel like I'm doing the wrong thing rejecting her attention, especialy since I haven't exactly been given much other attention. I feel like I wouldn't have the right to complain about that anymore. I'm also unsure whether she has been doing this from the start and I just havent noticed. Nor am I sure of what her reaction will be. I'm aware that there is an idea that guys are always supposed to 'want it' but I just don't, not with her. I don't know how to go about this. Should I talk to her? Should I just let semester end? Should I talk one on one? Or get some of my friends to help? (they have offered. I should have mentioned that, I'm not the only one seeing all this behaviour.)",36,1527811607.0,8njmuv,93,Dealing with unwanted attention.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/8njmuv/dealing_with_unwanted_attention/,2018-05-31 20:06:47

Several caveats:  
* May 2018 is the first time in a long time that two (2) boxes were released in the same month, hence there is an anomalous 500+60+30 gems in that regard.    
* Other anomalies are the 1000 gems for WCQ 2018 and 500 gems for 70 million downloads.  
* The method of accounting I've settled for is to include cumulative rewards as a lumpsum for the month in which it is concluded. Event of note for May 2018 would be Battle City, which started in the final week of April 2018. In that same manner, cumulative rewards for WCQ 2018 will only be accounted for in June 2018.  
* Daily rewards are accounted for on a daily basis. Hence, daily rewards for events that conclude in a different month will only be accounted for for the day it is received. Rewards of such nature are WCQ daily rewards and Yugi Muto Birthday Celebration daily rewards.  
* I admit I'm inconsistent when it comes to the Weekly Missions. The way it is now makes sense for the month, to me.   
* The expectation in terms of player competency is to play the bare minimum to acquire all non-RNG gems from all in-game events. This means one is expected to attain 80 PvP wins during the season, as well as obtain the required points for all daily and cumulative rewards for events. Kindly feedback if June 2018 shoud include gem income from attaining DLv Max, as currently gems income from PvP ladder does not include promotion to KoG.       
* Personally I do not complete the new box loaner decks and quizzes that give 60+30 gems, as they are timeless and can be kept indefinitely, only to be completed and redeemed when the need for every single gem available arises.    
* It will be tough to beat this month's income as there is a total of 2000+ gems that were rewarded out of the norm.  
* There is a post-submission error that I caught and have rectified. I missed out on Week 5's weekly missions, a delta of 20 gems.",33,1527812815.0,8njsv2,148,"For the Month of May 2018, a total of 5847 gems were available as income from reliable methods (non-RNG)",https://www.reddit.com/r/DuelLinks/comments/8njsv2/for_the_month_of_may_2018_a_total_of_5847_gems/,2018-05-31 20:26:55

| Number of small box equivalent | 1.46675 |

Several caveats:  
* May 2018 is the first time in a long time that two (2) boxes were released in the same month, hence there is an anomalous 500+60+30 gems in that regard.    
* Other anomalies are the 1000 gems for WCQ 2018 and 500 gems for 70 million downloads.  
* The method of accounting I've settled for is to include cumulative rewards as a lumpsum for the month in which it is concluded. Event of note for May 2018 would be Battle City, which started in the final week of April 2018. In that same manner, cumulative rewards for WCQ 2018 will only be accounted for in June 2018.  
* Daily rewards are accounted for on a daily basis. Hence, daily rewards for events that conclude in a different month will only be accounted for for the day it is received. Rewards of such nature are WCQ daily rewards and Yugi Muto Birthday Celebration daily rewards.  
* I admit I'm inconsistent when it comes to the Weekly Missions. The way it is now makes sense for the month, to me.   
* The expectation in terms of player competency is to play the bare minimum to acquire all non-RNG gems from all in-game events. This means one is expected to attain 80 PvP wins during the season, as well as obtain the required points for all daily and cumulative rewards for events. Kindly feedback if June 2018 shoud include gem income from attaining DLv Max, as currently gems income from PvP ladder does not include promotion to KoG.       
* Personally I do not complete the new box loaner decks and quizzes that give 60+30 gems, as they are timeless and can be kept indefinitely, only to be completed and redeemed when the need for every single gem available arises.    
* It will be tough to beat this month's income as there is a total of 2000+ gems that were rewarded out of the norm.  
* There is a post-submission error that I caught and have rectified. I missed out on Week 5's weekly missions, a delta of 20 gems.",33,1527812815.0,8njsv2,144,"For the Month of May 2018, a total of 5847 gems were available as income from reliable methods (non-RNG)",https://www.reddit.com/r/DuelLinks/comments/8njsv2/for_the_month_of_may_2018_a_total_of_5847_gems/,2018-05-31 20:26:55

# I Introduction

u/tahsinsy back with some fresh updated version of the beloved Full Superbuy Guide and some top secret insider info about customs ^^ok ^^maybe ^^not ^^so ^^top ^^secret ^^anymore

There are still many many people who ask me questions and ask for help to ship their hauls safely to their country or hundreds of people who thank me that they got their hauls through customs. I think we need
an update on this topic. Many things changed, many things stayed the same. If you still have any questions feel free to hmu. As
always this is 100% unbiased, 100% real, 100% raw, 100% as objective as possible and 100% probably a bit too late for some.

# II - General Info About Taobao Agents
### 1. What is an Agent ?
For new users coming to this sub daily it is hard to directly understand the point of an agent. Be honest, you did not do better in your 
first days/weeks. So instead of redirecting them to the searchbar just explain it to them in 2 sentences. 

The main website we buy our reps from is taobao.com. It is like a amazon or eBay for China - solely for China. The problem that results
is that we need a connection between your country and China. You cannot buy from TaoBao directly (for most of the countries) and you
probably would not understand anything. So here comes the agent in hand. You browse through your favorite TaoBao shops and find
some items you want to buy. Now you do not buy it through TaoBao but through your agent (in our case Superbuy). Superbuy now
buys this exact item and lets it deliver to their warehouse. You ask for pictures, measurements, exchanges, returns etc. When everything
is fine Superbuy will package everything and deliver it to you. They are the connection between you and TaoBao.


### 2. Which agent to use ?
I have experience with many agents and would call me able to compare them. I do not want to call out Agents and tell about bad 
experiences with them but I will tell you that Superbuy was the one with the most professional, honest, fast and caring service I could 
ever experience. If it would not be good it would not be the most popular agent ever. In my last Guide I compared prices of each agents 
and showed you how there is more than ""no service fee"", ""cheaper shipping costs"" since in the end every agent somehow earns his profit. 
There is no real price difference between agents, just use the one that will give you the best experience. In this Guide I will continue to
make examples and tutorials only about Superbuy. I am sorry if you use another agent but just keep Superbuy in mind when you plan
your next haul.

###3. Conclusion
Use any agent you want, there is no price difference and they all do the same job in general. I only advise you to use Superbuy because
of its services.

# III - The Superbuy Guide + **$30 Discount**
###1. Signing up + Get $30 Shipping Coupons/Discounts
Just press on the little ""Sign Up"" text on the top right corner and fill in the info. That's it. You can read more about the $30 Shipping Discounts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/eureplica/comments/7itj9x/discount_the_200_superbuy_discount_coupons/). Do not worry, signing up is a normal thing. Beware that I would still advise you to use a unique password that you do not use for other websites - Safety reasons. Also don't worry about your payment information such as Paypal - You never enter your Paypal email + password on the Superbuy homepage, it always redirects you to Paypal's official website where you log in as usual. Superbuy also uses a secure connection between you and them (https). If you need more help to persuade your parents, hit me up lmao.

###2. Ordering Process - How to order
*As always thanks to u/wailll for his [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/5zf0zf/guide_how_to_order_from_superbuy/)*

1. Find the item you want on Taobao. Use this subreddit, try to find it yourself with [image search](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/5zds1k/guide_using_image_search_on_taobao/) or Google translate, whatever. For this example, we'll use the A$AP Rocky x Guess Tee from UnionKingdom.
2. Go to Superbuy, and [hover over the **Shopping Agent** button on the navbar](http://i.imgur.com/d2vOF5W.png). Click the blue box and paste your Taobao link into it.
3. You will be taken to a page like [this](http://i.imgur.com/lFRbqSg.png). Here, Superbuy translates the color and size options for you, and all you need to do is select the color and size you want. After, you can either **Add to Cart** or **Buy Now.** For this example, we'll assume that this shirt it the only thing you want.
4. You will next be taken to [this](http://i.imgur.com/sRk95Qw.png) page. Here, you have to select your country from the **Choose Destination Country** box, then hit submit to be taken to the payment screen.
5. If you have an existing balance in your Superbuy account from previous purchases that you have returned, you can use that to buy the product. [I have 91.06 yuan in my account already, so I just need to pay 18.94 yuan for this 110 yuan tee.](http://i.imgur.com/8fzyPFP.png)
6. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/lXw3PZV.png), just select Paypal and pay for your order.
7. Now, just wait until the seller ships his order. Once it arrives in the Superbuy warehouse, you will receive a notification.
8. Once your product arrives, [hover over your username in the navbar and select **My Warehouse**](http://i.imgur.com/RSSZ1aR.png). Here, you can [view QC, or quality control, pictures that Superbuy takes](http://imgur.com/a/rDCaU). One con of using Superbuy is their picture taking skills. To receive better pictures, you have to contact their **live chat** and give them your order number and request better QC pictures.
9. If you're satisfied with your order, select it and click **Submit** in the lower right corner. [**Here**](http://i.imgur.com/M9T2XRF.png), you can choose your preferred shipping method. The fashionreps favorite currently is EMS, but it's up to you what line you would like to use. Just select the shipping line, then click **Submit Delivery Order** to have Superbuy pack up your products and send it to your door.

###3. Post your hauls !
Posting reviews is what keeps this subreddit alive. People find new stuff, buy it, review it, search for pieces themselves, buy the, review 
them. This circle is the Reddit Rep Circle of Life. Don't forget to add pics (Please add a link to all pictures in one album, please. Please.).
Please follow these tips to post the PERFECT Review:

* You can use Spreadsheet or Reddit itself to write/structure it, no problem.
* Add a link to all pictures (QC or Fitpics) in one imgur album, please.
* If you use Spreadsheet please do this: You type in all brands/piece names in the Reddit post/title itself. That way we can use the search bar to actually
search for items
* Add your stats (weight, height, body type)

If you are unsure whether or not your item has any errors or has a good or bad quality - Just post your QC pictures here. There are so 
many people who know their stuff, let them check your item and give you advise. Don't forget this. Don't forget to write the name of the piece in the title.
Always think about the search bar, guys.

# IV - How To Avoid Customs
###1. Intro
Ok this may be the most important part of my Guide. How to avoid customs - especially when you are living in Europe (s/o to Germany). 
Not everything changed, but there are some IMPORTANT steps that I added to the checklist. DHL is the way to go for Germany, Austria
and many more European countries. If you live in the US, Canada you can choose EMS. Do NOT use EMS when you live in Germany
or Austria.

###2. Checklist
You may have to look up laws for any import fees or regulations. These numbers are an example for Superbuy shipping to Germany, it 
should work for any country though.

[ ] Stay at 4kg max. (4.5kg is possible but not advised)

[ ] If possible ask for no cardboard wrapping, let them package in DHL plastic bag

[ ] Ask for vacuum sealing (Possible in the fewest cases)

[ ] Ask them to wrap up your whole package with tape, a lot of tape.

[ ] Let them put a Commercial invoice on the outside (!)! of your package

[ ] The commercial invoice should have a value UNDER $24 including shipping costs

[ ] The commercial invoice has to be readable, if it has printing errors it has to be printed again

[ ] The commercial invoice has to state the shipping costs with a value >$0

[ ] The commercial invoice has to have a sender address

[ ] Your telephone number has to be stated on the commercial invoice

[ ] Let them send you a copy of the commercial invoice to your email (Will come back to this)

# V - General Tips About Superbuy/Shipping
* Use [Rehearsel Shipping](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/8n8hq2/how_to_save_money_on_superbuy_shipping/) to 
avoid paying too much shipping costs
* You can ship shoeboxes - Do not ship more than 2 shoeboxes in one package
* You can ship as many packages as you want simultaneously (Keep calm tho)
* Think twice before shipping shoeboxes, if you don't need them, don't ship them and let Superbuy throw them away
* If you have a non-Rep haul then you can probably use other shipping methods. Decide on your own. 
* Use ParcelFlow on your smartphone to satisfy your impatient self from looking at the tracking status every 5 min
* If Superbuy does not let you pay for your replicas directly through Paypal, just top up your account balance and then pay through your balance

# VI - What Happens When Your Haul Gets Seized By Customs
Keep. The. F***. Calm. This can have so many reasons. And I want to correct myself: It is a difference between your parcel is held up by 
customs and your parcel being seized by customs. Let me take all the fear from you.

If your parcel is held up DHL probably just messaged/emailed/called you and they told you some long story about some value declaration
and so on. To keep it short: DHL does not trust your invoice/can't read the invoice/is bored af and wants a proof of payment to declare the
value of your haul. For DHL Germany it is really easy to do this. You go to this [DHL Link](https://www.dhl.de/express/dhl4you) fill out the
information and upload a Paypal/Bank wire/Western Union/Payment Screenshot. For any other country: Search for the email address of
DHL Express Customs (not normal DHL) in your country. You can also call the DHL Express hotline and ask them. Email them the same
proof of payment screenshot. 

The bad side is that you will probably have to pay some importing fees (EUSt in Germany are 19% + 12,50‚Ç¨ DHL fees). I can tell you that
DHL Customs will not check if you send them an authentic screenshot of your Paypal transaction or if you managed to change up some
digits in order to stay under $24. To save the importing fees. I cannot tell you how to do it, though of course. ^^Google ^^inspect ^^element...
This is why it was important, that Superbuy sent you the Commercial Invoice they put on the parcel - You know exactly how high they
declared it and what they stated is inside.

The Tracking status should be ""Clearance Event"" when they want the proof of payment and should change to ""Clearance processing completed""
when it is done. This can take up to several days after you send them the screenshot.

If your haul really got seized (Tracking status ""Please contact DHL"") there is nothing you can do. DHL will send you a letter where they
will ask you for your permission to destroy the items. Just ignore this letter. It will automatically count as a permission (in Germany).
There is nothing else. You don't go to jail, you don't get a Million $ fine. Some DHL Customs worker told me that if you stay under 3 shoes
per package they will not contact the brand. But keep in mind, this is TOTALLY random. If you follow the checklist there is a micro chance
that you package will even get inspected. Because inspecting alone is not enough, so many DHL workers just don't care and pass Nike,
Adidas, Gucci Fakes. And if you really are that unlucky, just deal with it. Some sellers send out a replacement for free, some don't. 
You, Your family and your future kids will be safe, don't worry.

# VII - Useful Links

"Not trying to step on Walter's toes here.  He does good archival work.  But I noticed that prior to Dunkey and Leah enabling VODS he had to rely on recording the livestream himself and then uploading whatever he managed to catch, which sometimes shaved segments off of the streams.  His archive of Dunkey's second Sunshine stream is missing the first few minutes that I remember seeing live, and there was some funny shit in there.  

VODS were later activated so I was going to just download the VOD to have the full thing for myself, but being stupid I missed the expiration date by a day or two and now the VOD of that stream is gone.  :(   

Did anyone happen to download the full VOD from Twitch while it was still up?  It was the March 31 2018 stream that ended with the April Fools Lily Pad Level bit.  I'm not sure if anyone did, but if anyone has it and can share, you will be forever remembered as one true blue, truly cool dude.

"When I was about two , a woman walked into my room with a shirtless man and peered Into my crib . Her face twisted with horror and shock as she backed out of the room and screamed in the hallway. 

This memory followed me my entire life , it was one of the earliest I had , and one of the most vivid. My mother said someone on drugs broke into the house and my dad chased them out . 

I‚Äôm not going to smudge the fact that I took a heavy amount of acid one night just for fun when I was 21 and that I know it can alter the way someone takes In things as real and not real. I never thought more of LSD than just a fun trick of the brain , but this experience made me ward it off completely. 

I was camping , and walked off at night like a moron and became lost in the woods . I realized the danger I was in because I was tripping pretty badly and knew the best thing to do was stay still and wait even though time felt warped . 

I waited under a tree with my head tucked into my lap , when I looked up , I saw a red door just standing freely about 15 ft away. 

I couldn‚Äôt not walk to it , LSD was fun to me and I liked seeing what would happen . 

I didn‚Äôt note at the time the fact that it felt as if I was not tripping. Time felt intact and there was nothing out of place other than the door. 

I walked through it and found myself standing in a small living room with walls that had wood paneling and smelled like pot roast . I walked into the kitchen , admiring the checkered floors and collection of McDonald‚Äôs cups with various cartoon characters on them. 

Eventually, I wandered down to the hall, and that's when things became fucky. It suddenly felt real, like I could be caught and punished. I ducked into a small room, that was decorated like a nursery, and as soon as I saw the crib, I knew. 

I looked over the rail, and there was my younger self, looking back up at me. I felt panic as I turned around and began to quickly leave the home. My husband was standing behind me in the hall. he said something but it was like no air could pass between us to carry the noise. 

I ran past him, I wanted to see my parents. The door at the end of the hall flew open and there was my father, his eyes wide with fear and he looked right into mine. 

He yelled ‚ÄùGET THE FUCK OUT!!!‚Äù 

I began to scream. I wanted to hug him, to tell him it was me and I was so fucking scared and I didn't want to hurt anyone.

My mom appeared behind him with a handgun. 

I said ‚Äùdad it's me!!! Mom!!!! ‚Äù 

But she held the gun up and I ran for the door. When I opened it, there was no night sky, no dimly let pouch, just a vast amounts of color that I can only remember as white. I can only visually recall the color white, but I remember the inner dialogue of being overwhelmed by color and trying to grasp physical space. 

Eventually as the acid wore off, memory returned and I was tucked into a sleeping bag in a cabin. My husband came looking for me and said he found me clinging to a tree and I remained cationic until I fell asleep. 

It took me a long time to talk about it with anyone but I asked my mom one day to tell me more about what happened the night she chased the intruders from our home and she said : 
‚Äùthe women looked scared, she called out ‚Äôdad, mom!!‚Äô to us and that made it hard for me to point a gun at her, thank God it scare them off because I don't think I could have pulled that trigger looking at her. She's someone's daughter too .‚Äù  

I found out about four weeks after that trip that I was  15 weeks pregnant after being told my PCOS made it nearly impossible to have kids without medical assistance. 


I am 100% in agreement that the effects of LSD can do some super crazy shit to a person. I know what I felt. I know what I saw. 
I just don't understand what the fuck happened. 


Edit : Woah! Didn't expect this to blow up. I posted this really late from my phone as I was going to bed , sorry if it reads weird I was just trying to get it all out while remaining coherent. I'm really Sad I didn't get to respond to any of the comments, I didn't realize intoxicants are a no-no here (mah bad). Like I said before, I totally realize that the presence of LSD really affects the legitimacy of my experience .

I didn't ask my mom what the woman looked like because I know any sort of bias can affect the way she remembers things, and makes it invalid. What **did** make our conversation valid was the way she described things lines up perfectly with my experience without sharing my experience with her what so ever. I didn't know until that conversation that she even had a gun.

"Where do I even begin with this film? I went into not knowing anything about this movie apart from that is started Morgan Freeman. I‚Äôm glad I went into it going in blind because it made the reveals in the film so much more brilliant. So many iconic scenes and references in the film, I feel some what complete after seeing The Shawshank Redemption. 

Spoilers from now so if you haven‚Äôt seen it, do yourself a favour and go watch it immediately!



So the stand out scenes in this film for me were:

When Brooks leaves Shawshank to feel like an alien in the new world. The small details such as the fear in his eyes as his tightly grips the handle bar on the bus, a mode of transport he most likely has never taken before. Then the saddest part being where Brooks can no longer go on... 

The sheer shock and emotion on the inmates faces when they hear music for the first time in god knows how many years. As a musician and a music lovers, this seen really resonated with me, it truly shows the power that music has.

And finally the last 30 minutes of the film where the movie implies that Andy is going to take his own life but then is later revealed that he has been working on breaking out for years and has eventually seized his opportunity. 

This film is a masterpiece, true masterpiece!

"**Acquiesce**

/ÀåakwƒìÀàes/

A word originally from the Gheesling dialect particular to South Hospie (see also: *spicy drop*) that translates roughly to ""I will accept your word as law even though I believe it to be a mistake because I value your brotherhood more than my own life.""

*Yeah, I can* ***acquiesce*** *you that scopie, Dan.*

"The setting: 16:35, Monday, late April, post-Marathon (read:the beginning of busy season), Boston, Massachusetts.

It's a quiet day. No major guest issues. Came in early. Not oversold. My preferred PM team is on the desk. We're fucking *golden*. All of a sudden, my phone starts ringing off the hook. Every conversation is as follows:

>Guest: Hi, my name is *metallic level snowflake*, I just got a message through my *largest hotel chain in the world* app, saying that my reservation was canceled as requested. Only problem is that I didn't request a cancellation.

>Me: Oh my goodness Mr./Mrs. Snowflake, I'm not sure how this happened. Let me look into how this happened.

*I proceed to have no fucking clue how this happened because my PMS doesn't show me who canceled a reservation*

*Fast forward a half hour, where I've been on the phone with guests, snowflake hotline managers asking if we're closing the goddamn hotel, reservations agents asking what the fuck we're doing, etc., when all of a sudden my revenue folks walk out of there office saying something along the lines of ""Thank god we dodged that bullet.""*

Turns out, *someone* made a ""mistake"" with our rate program where the entirety of June was available at my hotel for $142 a night. The problem is that this is our high rate season where even my cheapest rooms are $500 a night - Boston during graduation season is a goddamn nightmare. So, what does revenue decide to do? *Eat that revenue loss?* **LOL NO** they decide to cancel everyone who booked at that rate without reaching out to the guest first. Even more egregious, they decide to not tell the only fucking manager of a shortstaffed front desk department. 

They decide to have the GM send out an email saying basically that *this is a high revenue week for us and we goofed* and that if they would like to rebook with us they're more than welcome to do so at the new rate ($400 more than their original rate). And who told them they had to do this whenever they called? ME.

**AND FUCKING THEN** - Upper management realized their fuckup and their breach of contract, and decided that anyone who complained through the proper channels should be reinstated at their original rate.  So fucking now, when **all** of these guests show up next weekend for graduation, they'll have 10/10 stays, but still give 0 scores on reviews, and they'll mention me, because I was the original point of contact on all this bullshit. And my final fucking concern: Our policy is to oversell by 2, but fuck me, I'm gonna have 10 people show up who didn't realize their reservation was canceled, and I'm gonna have to walk 10 people on night where there are literally zero rooms in the city.

*Fuck.*

"It's the beginning of the end I hope.

So, for our benefits, you have to do a monthly reporting thing, stuff like, has the number of people living with you changed, change of residence, any money earned/given, that sort of thing. She lied through all of it apparently, and when mom called what she thought was maintenance enforcement and after she sent along the parental order to them, they called back with the real number for maintenance enforcement and said they had to cut off Shelly's benefits because she lied on the reporting. So she went from $1700 a month and 100% of meds covered to nothing. Now she has to go through the 2-4 week process of getting back on them(if she can even manage all the paperwork she needs to bring each time, if she can't it'll go up to an infinite week process), and she'll get a max of $500 a month, with meds covered.

A few days before she was supposed to get her benefit check, she had called grandpa asking for money, and then when he said no she swore at him and hung up. Then she sheepishly called him last night and asked for money again and he said no, but now he's pissed at her. She also called grandma again and asked for money too. Mom wound up sending her $50 out of pity, and because grandma begged her, and mom has to pay grandma's credit card bill this month because grandma sent shelly the $200 that was supposed to go to it earlier this month.

Grandpa told her she wasn't getting any money from him until she has physical proof that she is enrolled in continuing education to get her high school diploma(she can do this for free) and is attending therapy(also available for free). He also said he can't support 3 families on his income, so she has to get back on benefits and he's cutting her off soon. Us being the second until mom gets back on her feet mentally and emotionally from this whole ordeal and can return to work, he only helps with a few hundred a month I believe(besides the lawyer), but I'm kept in the dark about financials.

Mom, grandma and grandpa are worried that she's either going to become homeless or kill herself soon, I think she's too self-absorbed to kill herself and will get a boyfriend so she can quickly move in him with if it comes to that. 

Supervised visitation is on saturday(and it only costs us $15 per hour), if shelly even shows up, and it's auto canceled if she doesn't bring everything niece would need for the three hours. Diapers, wet wipes, bum cream, food, sun screen, bottles(sippy cup or bottled water), change of clothes, that sort of thing. Mom also has to stay in the area in case shelly acts up because mom told the place about shelly's tendencies, or there is any abuse of any kind(emotional, verbal, physical[yanking her arm]). Who wants to bet that shelly brings the father if she actually does show up?

The phone call was ended within fifteen minutes on tuesday night because Shelly brought niece's father on the video call, and that's against the visitation order(only shelly is to be on these calls), so mom took action and ended the call, because after he comes on the screen, niece wants nothing to do with it. I guess she still thinks of me as ""Daddy"" and doesn't like it when shelly says ""and here's daddy to talk to you."" Mom still hasn't talked to the lawyer yet about recording them, but we're going to record the call tonight just in case we can, federally we're one party consent, but we don't know exact laws for our province. 

On a brighter note, on tuesday night after I brought niece something to munch on before bed, she said ""I love you uncle [my name] daddy."" Overall, niece is very happy 75% of the time, with 20% of the time devoted to toddler melt downs, and the other 5% is being sad about missing her mom. She's also going through the night without wetting her diaper now, and peeing as soon as she wakes up. She also holds her poop in at early preschool/daycare all day and then goes to the closet now as soon as she gets home(because we put the potty in her poop corner to try and get her to use it). 

So now, no income, not a stable place to live, and mentally unwell, we're 99% going to get full custody and only supervised visitation.

Edit: Mom got access to shelly's email account(a while ago she gave mom her email and password), and looks like she logged into grandma's bank account and emailed herself $20. Grandma said she didn't send it.",21,1527821422.0,8nkziw,84,"Shelly has lost her benefits, for lying in the monthly reporting, and mom accidentally narcing on her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/8nkziw/shelly_has_lost_her_benefits_for_lying_in_the/,2018-05-31 22:50:22

"So back in February there was a man that looked homeless walking up and down my street. My partner and I were outside working in the yard so we paid a little attention but didn't think anything of it. The next day he showed back up. Walked up my driveway and camped on my porch. When we asked what he was doing he said he was going to ""fix this place up real nice. Get himself a dog and some flowers in the front."" We asked him to leave to which he answered ""No. I live here now. I have the papers giving me permission to live here."" He then handed us a change of address form from the state housing authority where he had changed his mailing address to mine. This was not permission to live at my home but letting them know to send his mail there. I should point out at this point I don't know this guy. I have never met this guy. Neither has my partner. We asked him to leave again or we would call the cops after getting a picture of the form. I spent all day on the phone with the state housing agency trying to figure out what the hell but they had no answers. 


A week goes by and we don't hear from the man. Then, I walk out to check my mail and he is waiting at the mailbox. He opens it every few minutes but the mail hasn't come yet. He tells me to leave him alone, this doesn't concern me, he doesn't want to talk to me, he is just waiting for his check and then he is going to go home (pointing to my house). I remind him he doesn't live there and start dialing the cops. He takes off swearing at me the whole way. The cops ask if he is on the property currently, when I say no, they say call back when he is and they will come out. I also put a hold on my mail that day because I don't know if he was stealing it. 


A few weeks go by and strange things are happening around the outside of my house. My trashcans get taken to the street and brought back. My weeds are pulled. My lawn furniture is rearranged but I don't see the guy again. The cops offer to add more patrols but unless they catch him on the property they won't do anything. They start to act like I am crazy because I am calling everyday. At one point the officer that came out after I found threatening notes taped to the front door asked me if I can prove this person doesn't live there because ""this sounds like a domestic dispute, we don't handle those."" I start to feel like I am going crazy. 


Finally, after about a month of this my husband and I come home from a late dinner out with friends. We walk into the house and smell shampoo. Then we hear the shower. Then we hear the sounds of someone talking. We turn around and leave. Get in the car and park it at the end of the street to call the cops and watch the front door. 


The cops come. They have megaphones and keep telling him to come out of the house with his hands up. No response so they charge the front door and drag him out of the shower. There is a struggle and he starts to fight them. He can't believe he is being treated this way in his own home! How dare they! We can hear him yelling from our vantage point at the end of the street. He won't come willingly so the cops taser him in my front hallway. He is finally compliant at that point. They grab my husband's shoes from next to the door and tell him to put them on. They march him out to the waiting police car. 


After filling out all the reports we are allowed to go back in the house. He had smashed out all our windows so there was glass everywhere. He ate the left over chicken parm in the fridge. In my bedroom my bed is messed up, he had slept in my bed. My clothing is all over the floor because he emptied my dresser to put his things in. We had just put our dog down a few months before and the urn was on the table. He broke it open and spread the ashes all over my bedroom and bathroom- which might be why he was taking a shower. He used an entire bottle of $90 skin serum and almost a whole bottle of shampoo. But he folded all my towels he had taken into the bathroom with him nicely and hung them on the rack. Thank god he didn't hurt my cats. 


He is currently in jail on three charges, breaking and entering, assaulting an officer when he fought the cops and destruction of property. His trial is next week. I have been in touch with the DA and the arresting officer, both of whom have spoken with him. He is pissed he is in jail and keeps telling them to let him out because no one is watching his house and he doesn't want it to get broken into. I am still getting his mail...

"A few days ago was my daughter‚Äôs 10th birthday. I picked her up from school and had to run into the grocery store. This particular store has a popular coffee shop inside. She loves the cakes pops and asked if she could get one. I agreed and ordered a drink with one barista while the other helped my daughter. She couldn‚Äôt make up her mind which one she wanted. Her favorite is chocolate chip, but she felt that since it was her birthday she needed to get the birthday one. I explain the dilemma she is having to the barista and she tells me they are on sale 2 for $3. 

In order to hurry up my birthday girl I tell her to go ahead and get one of each. We move to the side to pay. The lady hands her the bag of cake pops and tells her Happy Birthday and tells me that the treats are on them. I thank them profusely, pay for my drink and we continue to shop. When she opens her bag she sees not just the 2 cake pops, but 4 of them. They gave her one of each flavor they had. She was on cloud nine. They made her special day a little more special.

"From the Greeks to Romans to the Norse, all had converted at some point to Christianity. Why exactly did this happen? I understand the shift to Christianity wasn't overnight but there must have been something seemingly ""superior"" about this monotheistic religion over the polytheistic. 

From my \(limited\) knowledge of the subject, Christianity had an idea of an eternal Hell whereas others did not. Could this fear of Hell have played a big role in the transition?

"I'm really self conscious posting this because I know I still have a long, long way to go before I'm at my goal. I recently found this picture from 2010. This was post Atkins diet and losing over a 100 pounds, and then gaining it all back and then some. I would estimate my weight here was probably near 350, but I never got near a scale then. In October I visited the doctor and when it came back that my sugar was out of control, and when the scale was reading 319, I decided it was time to make a change and I haven't looked back since! Everyone mentions that they see the differences, and obviously I can tell in my clothes and my wedding rings, but I don't see it in the mirror. But after finding this picture, I finally see that I have made progress, even if it's not obvious to me, I know I have worked my butt off for the past 7 months to get where I am now, and I need to be proud of myself even if I'm not at the end of my journey yet.

"Hey r/Boardgames

**Edit:** Adding my BGG ratings for those who asked for it: https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/Texjets281?rated=1&subtype=boardgame&ff=1

I just got back from BGGSpring2018, and had an awesome time as always.  We had a group of 4 ‚Äúlocals‚Äù and met up with our BGGCon buddy from Florida, and played a ton of games, including all 9 SdJ Nominees and a ton of new hotness.  See below for my thoughts on each of the SdJ categories, and other games played.  Chime in on your thoughts, and if you were also to BGGSpring tell me about your experience!
Also I use the following scale when reviewing games.  Games that receive 6‚Äôs and 7‚Äôs I consider Above Average/Good Games, with 5‚Äôs being pretty average, so when I rate a bunch of games 5-8, that‚Äôs a pretty good convention experience:

10 - Outstanding

9 - Excellent

8 - Very good

7 - Good

6 ‚Äì Ok to Above Average

5 ‚Äì Mediocre/Average

4 - Not so good

3 - Bad 

2 - Very bad

1 - Awful

**Game of the Convention ‚Äì Decrypto**   I‚Äôm as shocked as anyone, that a party game, let alone one that has been  described as a ‚ÄúCodenames Re-implementation‚Äù  was my game of the convention, but it honestly blew me and most of my group away.   Decrypto is a game where you give clues to your opponent to guess secret words, but the other team can hear your clues, and tries to use the pattern of clue to discover the secret words.  I admit to being a sucker for Team vs. Team games, and this one offered so many hilarious moments, and really gives the players opportunities to be creative and clever.   There is this great tension that occurs once one of the teams gets a mis-communication marker, as they have to suddenly start giving more straight-forward clues so they don‚Äôt lose, but the opposing team knows that and is more likely to intercept codes.  There is a great tension once a team gets a successful intercept token, as then the other team has to try to come up with even more obscure clues and can end up confusing their teammates and losing the game that way.  We busted this out 3 times during the convention, and had stories and memorable wins and losses from each game.  Love it.  The comparison to Codenames is fair, but they have some significant difference.  That being said, as soon as we packed this up for the first time, I knew that I would NEVER play Codenames again if I had this as an option.  That‚Äôs how good this was.  Will purchase(maybe my only ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù from the con).  **[9/10]**

**Now, onto my thoughts of the Spiel Des Jahres games:**

**Azul**:  Almost everyone has expected this to be nominated for the SdJ since it first released, and when the nominees were announced, this was the declared the heavy favorite to win by most.  I had played this before, and I think it‚Äôs pretty good, but not that great. We have only played the ‚Äúbasic‚Äù side of the boards, where the tile spaces are pre-determined, so I may be missing the full experience, but I‚Äôm not huge on abstracts, and I‚Äôm a fan of integrated theme, so this game was already fighting an uphill battle for me, and it didn‚Äôt quite make it.  It‚Äôs very well produced and has a unique look to it, and mechanically is a well thought out game with the potential to be played to a deep strategy, but it didn‚Äôt excite me or do anything new that made me want to play it again.  For games of this type, I still think Sagrada is the my favorite.  **[6/10]**

**The Mind** - The Mind is a card game where the group tries to play a deck of cards in ascending order‚Ä¶.without talking.  That‚Äôs 95% of the rules.  People are asking if this is even technically a game? Probably, but who cares. There was some big buzz for this game in the month or so before the convention, as it was making its rounds through the board game media circles.  There was this funny dichotomy between the groups of people who had played the game and were raving about it like lunatics, and those who had just read the rules or seen it played and thought it was the dumbest game ever.  When I first read the rules and saw a playthrough of this, I had my doubts as well, but having played it now at all player counts, and watching countless groups have a blast with it at the convention, I can safely say this game is a truly unique experience that any friend group or family can just pick up and try within a few minutes, and have a wonderful time.  That‚Äôs basically the top criterion for a game winning the SdJ, and I hope that it wins.  We have had some memorable moments  of excellence and embarrassing failure with this, both of which make the game great!  This will undoubtedly fail with some groups who don‚Äôt like games like this, but for those who do, believe the hype. **[8/10]**

**Luxor** -  I hadn‚Äôt even heard of this before the nominees were announced, but I was pretty excited once I started reading deeper.  Luxor is a ‚Äúrace‚Äù game, where players move their handful of pieces around a spiral shaped map, and get points based on how far they have gotten when the game ends, with some bonus points for reaching the center, or picking up some items along the way.  The unique mechanic that makes this game interesting is that you have a 5 card hand, and to move, you need to play a card allowing you to move a certain number of spaces, but you can only play cards from either end of your hand, and you can‚Äôt re-arrange the order of your cards.  Similar to Bohnanza, this adds both limitations and interesting strategy to your game as you have to plan multiple turns ahead to try to pull off clever exact moves.  With all that though, this game is just so damn boring.  The theme is bland, the art is kinda nice but looks bland on the table.  It just wasn‚Äôt fun, and I‚Äôm not sure why.  The game decisions are so basic, and even a ‚Äúclever‚Äù play is just ‚ÄúI moved 2, then 1, then 2!‚Äù.  I really wish they had found a deeper more interesting game to add that hand-order mechanic to, because it‚Äôs great.  This was Dullsville for everyone we played with.**[5/10]**


My rankings:  **The Mind**, Azul, Luxor  
Predictions:  Tough call here, Luxor is easily the more traditional nominee, but it doesn‚Äôt hold up to the standard of past years or this year‚Äôs nominees.   Azul is the safe pick, but gut feeling says the committee is seeing how much these strangers are enjoying the Mind and will pick the gutsy game for the win.  




**KennerSpiel Des Jahres:**
This is category I get excited for, and this year I hadn‚Äôt even heard of 2 of the games, which gets me even more amped.

**Heaven and Ale** I have played this at 2P and 3P counts now, and it‚Äôs been enjoyable at both.  Of the three game nominated for Kennerspiel, this is by far the heaviest.  The theme is great and unique, monks running a brewery and brewing beer.  You need to collect ingredients and plant them for more money and for points.  The main strategy section of this game revolves around the action spaces, which you can travel as far forward as you like down the track, but can never go backwards.   Do you rush far ahead for the good stuff, or go slowly and scoop up the crappy bits.  I generally love games with this, and this game does it pretty well.  The End game scoring is very unique and brilliant in this game, where you sort of average out how well you did in each of your beer ingredients, and get bonuses depending on how for you moved your head brewmaster down the track.  I live the game, I‚Äôd play it again, but it doesn‚Äôt wow me.  As cool as the theme is, it doesn‚Äôt feel implemented particularly well, and if I want to play a game with the risk-track mechanic, I prefer others(like Francis Drake).  **[7/10]**

**Die Quacksalber von Quedlinburg** We were taught this by Martin from the SdJ Committee, who is just the most wonderful and pleasant person, and we are so thankful and appreciative of the committee traveling to BGGCon just to teach people games for 8 hours each day.
In this game, you play a ‚ÄúQuack‚Äù doctor, who wants to brew powerful potions, but is on a budget and has to use poor, dangerous ingredients.  It‚Äôs a press your luck game where you draw ingredients from a bag, and each time you draw one, add them to your potion cauldron.  Draw too many dangerous ones and your potion explodes, which has some penalties.  The press your luck aspect of this game is great and the theme is exceptionally good and fun.  It‚Äôs light-hearted, and this isn‚Äôt a game for hardcore strategy players, as luck can play a factor at times, but it‚Äôs  great fun to risk making an awesome potion because you just need 1 more dollar or want to beat your friend to have the round‚Äôs best potion.  It‚Äôs very well produced, the artwork on the ingredients and boards is very charming, and we love press your luck.  The game even has a clever mechanic to prevent a runaway leader, and the variance of the events and different ingredient types can bring the game some longevity, although if I owned it I‚Äôm not sure if I could get it out that often without it feeling samey.  Good enough that we played it twice.  A little light compared to typical KSdJ nominees though, I could have seen this in the SdJ Category(felt similar to Broom Service).
   **[8/10]**

**Ganz Schon Clever** - A roll and write, and a pretty good one at that.  I‚Äôm not a big fan of roll and writes, and I really haven‚Äôt played many, but this was fun and very each to teach and play.  Basically you roll 6 dice, draft a few to cross off spaces on your mat, and then the other players get to use one that you chose not to use.  There is a section for each color die, and a wild die that can be used anywhere.   Each section scores slightly differently, but most have to do with how often you use those particular dice.  The clever spin is that if you progress far enough down certain tracks, you unlock bonus rolls and powers, including ‚ÄúFoxes‚Äù, which at the end of the game count as additional points equal to the worst of your 5 sections.  This means you can go super hard on some sections for mad points, or try to be pretty average at everything and get foxes, which will count for a ton at the end.  I liked it, we played it twice, at 3P and 4P, and it was always good.  There‚Äôs no theme here though, and this will feel similar every time.  A good game, but again, this was light for a KSdJ nominee, VERY light actually.  I‚Äôve heard people argue that this is KsDJ because it‚Äôs hard to teach and learn, but I don‚Äôt see that at all, this was a 5 minute learn and then a 2-3 minute teach for us.  I can see Azul being considered heavier, and wonder if Azul could have swapped placed as the KsDJ nominee, since there is an obvious depth of strategy and some opportunity to counterplay and screw your opponents in that game, AND it‚Äôs harder to teach and learn.  Hmm.    **(6/10)**

My rankings:  **Die Quacksalber von Quedlinburg**, Heaven and Ale,  Ganz Schon Clever  

Predictions:  Again tough because the games are so different and of such different complexities.  Gut feeling says Heaven and Ale, with Quacksalber being the dark horse.  I‚Äôd be surprised if Ganz Schon Clever wins.

A/N: Good morning everyone!  Grab your coffee, grab your bagel, grab your nearest internet enabled device because [we're back!] [g] Today's high five goes to /u/gcorebyte for breaking /u/cateowl's streak.  Before we begin, a brief word of heartfelt thank you to everyone who's contributed to this story monetarily over the last couple of weeks since that option went live.  Thank you very much.  Oh and I suppose I should mention again that the HEL Jumper does have a discord.  PM me for an invite!

*Veera‚Äôs genetic material is xDNA.*  For a long moment Winters and Veera just looked at one another.

‚ÄúUh, it‚Äôs what?‚Äù  Veera asked him, feeling none too great at having yet another arcane term dropped on her, but feeling better after seeing a similarly confused look on her human‚Äôs face.

‚ÄúShe said xDNA,‚Äù Winters repeated, looking between the two strands curiously.

‚ÄúSo that means what, exactly?‚Äù  

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.  It‚Äôs clearly DNA‚Ä¶but x,‚Äù Winters spoke with mock seriousness.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs x?‚Äù  Veera played along.

‚ÄúOh, well it‚Äôs this letter here.‚Äù  Winters pointed to the four letter acronym below Veera‚Äôs spinning double helix.  ‚ÄúSo those three letters are D N A.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, so that‚Äôs what D and N look like!  I don‚Äôt think I did those ones too well, not that it was Io‚Äôs fault.  I just had a hard time picturing it.  I can see the A though!‚Äù  Veera was mollified as they switched gears briefly to discuss human runes, a much simpler and comprehensible subject than whatever ‚Äògenetic material‚Äô was.  

‚ÄúRight, did you learn uppercase and lowercase?‚Äù  Winters asked.

‚ÄúIo explained the concept briefly, but the lowercase letters were very hard to imagine.  They seem to involve fewer straight lines and easy angles.  I like these capital letters, they‚Äôre easier.‚Äù  Veera related her relative success and failure.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, there will be plenty of time in the future for you to work on them,‚Äù Winters reassured her warmly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worried love.  It‚Äôs something I have to do, so I‚Äôll do it.  It would be nice to get lessons from you sometime as well,‚Äù she said hopefully.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be sure to do that then.  I guess we can have a little lesson about x right now.  See how it‚Äôs smaller than the D?‚Äù

‚ÄúMhm!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the nice thing about that letter.  All you have to do is size it differently.  It otherwise looks the same no matter if it‚Äôs upper or lowercase.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see.  So‚Ä¶what does it mean though?‚Äù  Veera asked again, catching Io‚Äôs exasperated expression out of the corner of her eye.  It was obvious enough that Winters had seen it too and was intentionally dragging on the conversation.

‚ÄúWell, like I said, it means you have DNA, like I do‚Ä¶only x.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo x means wider?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn this context apparently,‚Äù Winters agreed.

‚ÄúAnd that means‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBeats me.‚Äù  

‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù

‚ÄòAhem!‚Äô  Io finally snapped, tapping her feet impatiently.  ‚ÄòIf the two of you are well and done playing ignoramus I‚Äôd be happy to teach you what the x means.‚Äô  Io accompanied her declaration with savage air quotes.  The subsequent laughter of Veera and Winters did not improve her mood.  ‚ÄòOh yes, join Omega Division they said, see the galaxy they said!  They never mentioned anything about thick headed HEL Jumpers and their propensity for getting friendly with sassy natives.  I should have stayed in a Beta lab,‚Äô Io muttered sarcastically.  

‚ÄúIo, did I just hear right?  Did you, the queen of sass, just refer to someone else as sassy?‚Äù  Winters asked with mock sternness, placing a hand over his heart.  ‚ÄúI do believe the world might be ending.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh stop it you!‚Äù  Veera giggled, nevertheless hugging his arm and drawing them close together again, hoping to show her thanks for his light-hearted attitude while she stared her ‚Äòtrue nature‚Äô in its incomprehensible face.  ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt lie to us Io, you love being out here in the wilds.‚Äù

‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not wrong Veera, but you and the Lieutenant are being very dismissive of my work!  I‚Äôve been waiting for hours to share this with you!‚Äô  Io explained in a hurt tone of voice.  Veera looked up at Winters who began to console his partner.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry Io; we didn‚Äôt mean it that way.  Veera‚Äôs still a little freaked out over all of this, ok?  There have been a lot of words and concepts that we‚Äôve introduced her to recently that, even with your translation program, are probably very alien to her.  We were trying to lighten the mood a little, you know?‚Äù  Io sighed and dropped her combative look.

‚ÄòI understand sir, though I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs more effective than me just explaining what this is.  Knowledge is power.‚Äô

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm prepared to hear about it now.  Would you explain what the x really means Io?‚Äù Veera requested, much to the VI‚Äôs satisfaction.

‚ÄòOf course Veera,‚Äô Io replied, highlighting portions of the nucleotides in the model of Veera‚Äôs DNA.  Winters looked closer.

‚ÄúSix sided, all the same element‚Ä¶are those benzene rings Io?‚Äù  Winters asked, pointing to them so that Veera could match the word to the object.  ‚ÄúYou see those Veera?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do Russell, and I can see that your‚Ä¶DNA?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs how you pronounce it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, thank you.  So yes, as I was saying, your DNA doesn‚Äôt appear to have those.  It has these rings‚Ä¶but they don‚Äôt have the same color at each point,‚Äù Veera observed, able to differentiate between normal nucleotides and x-nucleotides thanks to Io‚Äôs color coding of the different atoms that made each molecule, reducing the exercise to pattern recognition.  Io commanded their attention again, vanishing the molecular models in favor of the letters A, T, C, and G.

‚ÄúOh hey!  I know those!‚Äù  Veera exclaimed happily, recognizing more of the runes that Io had tried to explain to her.  ‚ÄúWhat do they stand for?‚Äù

‚ÄòRemember how DNA looks like a ladder of sorts?‚Äô  Io asked, quickly displaying a stylized DNA molecule.  ‚ÄòThese are the four letters that make up the rungs of the ladder, the area that connects the two outer strands, as you can see here.  That is how this molecule stores information, in the ordering of these letters.‚Äô

‚ÄúThat must be very, very long then if you only have four runes?‚Äù  Veera remarked, understanding enough to realize how complicated a creation she and Winters were.

‚ÄòIndeed Veera, the letters line up like so.  A will always pair with T.  G will always pair with C.  In this way, even if you only have one half of the strand, these rules ensure you can re-create it and pass on that information.  Do you understand so far?‚Äô  Io checked to make sure she wasn‚Äôt losing her pupils.  Winters, knowing that much from school, allowed Veera to answer.  After looking hard at Io‚Äôs visual displays, Veera eventually nodded.  ‚ÄòVery good Veera.  Now, your DNA is special.  Instead of four letters, you have eight.‚Äô

‚ÄúEight?  I have twice as many as Russell?‚Äù

‚ÄòYes.  You have his letters, as well as variants of each, like so.‚Äô  Io presented the A, T, C, and G again, as well as xA, xT, xC, and xG as well as their molecular structures.

‚ÄúOh, there are the rings again!‚Äù  Veera pointed out, seeing now that each of the modified letters contained that extra ring.

‚ÄòYes Veera.  Because of those rings, each x has to pair with its non-x twin; otherwise the molecule would have a variable width and not be stable.‚Äô  Io reset the display to show the eight possible pairings, but noticed that Veera was developing a nervous and confused look.  ‚ÄòI can see that I‚Äôm losing you a bit.  How best to explain this?‚Äô  She pondered, tapping her chin with a finger.  ‚ÄòAh, yes!  That should work!  Veera, today you were introduced to the twenty six letters of the human alphabet, yes?‚Äô

‚ÄúMhm,‚Äù Veera affirmed.

‚ÄòWith those twenty six letters you can write any word in the English language, as well as any other language that uses that particular alphabet.  Now, what is your body made of?‚Äô

‚ÄúUh, cells?‚Äù  Veera repeated the unfamiliar word, unsure what answer Io was looking for.  She‚Äôd only just learned that she wasn‚Äôt a monolithic creation of Seil.

‚ÄòWell, yes.  However, I was referring to your fur and skin, muscle and bone, those sorts of things.‚Äô

‚ÄúOh, alright!  That‚Äôs actually easier,‚Äù Veera said, happy they were at least talking about things she could see.  Io continued.

‚ÄòWe use the letters of the alphabet to make words.  And those words become sentences and language.  In the same way, our bodies use the letters of DNA to make words.  Those words form sentences that create muscle for instance, or hair.  Does that make a bit more sense?‚Äô  Io asked, hoping that the combination of the two disciplines would help Veera connect the abstract topic of molecular biology to something she had experienced in her life.  Winters, for his part, looked impressed at her thinking but allowed the situation to continue to play out without his interference.  Veera fluttered her feathers and nodded.

‚ÄúYes Io, I believe I understand.  But how is my language special then?‚Äù

‚ÄòAn excellent question.  The human language of DNA has sixty four words.  Each word is three letters long,‚Äô Io told her.  Veera cradled her chin in her hand and considered the ceiling for a long moment.

‚ÄúThat makes sense.  You have four choices for letter number one, four for letter two, and so on.‚Äù  Veera explained, also arriving at sixty four.  Io looked at Winters, dumbfounded.

‚ÄòShe has an extraordinary capacity for basic mathematics considering her circumstances sir.‚Äô  Winters nodded in agreement, but reprimanded her.

‚ÄúIo, it‚Äôs rude to talk about people like that when you‚Äôre right in front of them.  Why don‚Äôt you try that again?‚Äù  Winters prompted, pointing a finger at Veera.  Io looked at Veera awkwardly.

‚ÄòPardon me Veera.  You have an innate understanding of basic number manipulation that surprises me.‚Äô

‚ÄúUh, thank you?  I think?‚Äù  Veera replied, unsure of what exactly she‚Äôd done to earn the VI‚Äôs praise.

‚ÄòIt was most certainly a compliment Veera.  As I was saying though, the wonder of your xDNA and the reason I so desperately wish I could study it more is because with eight unique letters‚Ä¶‚Äô  She allowed the sentence to hang, wondering if Veera would understand where she was going.  For a while Veera narrowed her eyes in thought, relaxing a bit as her boyfriend tended lightly to her ears.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd only need two letters‚Ä¶‚Äù Veera eventually whispered.

‚ÄòExactly!‚Äô  Io jumped and clapped her hands, gleeful at Veera‚Äôs comprehension.  ‚ÄòWith just two letters your body is capable of the same complexity as the Lieutenant‚Äôs.  There are only twenty known building blocks of the body, so sixty four words is redundant, but it makes me wonder!  Is your genome much shorter than his?  Do you have much more complex regulatory sequences or introns?  Does your body follow the same processes for replication of DNA as that of a human or does it do something completely novel?  There are so many potential implications, all from the addition of that benzene ring!‚Äô  Io concluded, her eyes practically sparkling with the desire to understand the unknown.  Veera and Winters couldn‚Äôt help but smile at her enthusiasm.

‚ÄúThat is‚Ä¶interesting Io.  I can‚Äôt say I really understand any of what you just said, but I get that I have double the letters and this means that my body can potentially do things either more efficiently, more complicated, or both.  I‚Äôm not sure I got much beyond that.  There were quite a few words that didn‚Äôt translate at the end,‚Äù Veera admitted.  Io seemed untroubled.  

‚ÄòThat is no problem at all Veera; you got the main thrust of the issue.  Did I help to assuage some of your fears?‚Äô

‚ÄúYes, thank you for asking Io.  It‚Äôs all quite‚Ä¶difficult to believe, but if it is true then maybe Russell and I aren‚Äôt so different?‚Äù  Veera concluded, giving her mate a brief nuzzle.  

‚ÄòI‚Äôm glad to hear that.  I suppose we can leave any other discussions of this type alone unless they become necessary in the future, but I thank you for allowing me some time to explain this.  If we are ever in a lab I would love to take another blood sample!‚Äô

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a lab?‚Äù  Veera requested of Winters.  He shifted slightly atop the straw before answering.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a place where humans study the world and create new things.  We have labs to study living things, labs to test and create new weapons, labs to work on developing new materials for armor or clothing, labs for anything really.  It‚Äôs how we understand and manipulate the world around us.  I think Thantis‚Äô temple is the closest thing that you have here.  He does rudimentary healing, and seeks to understand basic Cauthan physiology, right?  He studies the body?‚Äù  Veera nodded.  ‚ÄúDoes that answer your question?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt does Russell.  I shudder at the idea of being a subject of‚Ä¶study, but it completely makes sense that you would devote specific space to the pursuit of practical learning,‚Äù Veera told him, causing him to shoot a pointed look at Io.  The VI had procured a folder and was jotting down notes.

‚ÄòI am retaining this information for later Veera.  If we are rescued I am sure we will both be subjects of curiosity.  I will not allow them to experiment on you against your will,‚Äô Io insisted emphatically, drawing surprised and then compassionate looks from the other two.  Winters realized that Io‚Äôs immediate understanding made sense in a way; it was surely something that she was worried about in her own case as well.  Veera leaned over and poked Io with her nose.  The projection shimmered around her as Io flailed a bit and regained her center.

‚ÄúThank you Io!  That means a lot to me.  The things that humans have done and the things that they know are very frightening at times,‚Äù she admitted.

‚ÄúSorry love,‚Äù Winters murmured sadly, kissing the top of her head.  

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault darling.  If we were to remain here, it would be wonderful for me.  I get you and I get to remain comfortable in my way of life.  But I understand things might happen the other way around.  It‚Äôs better if I get used to all of this now, used to feeling lost and out of sorts.‚Äù  Veera reasoned, returning his kiss with a chaste lick of his cheek.  Winters nodded.

‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôd be a little afraid too, remaining here forever.  The idea of adapting for the long term, for the rest of my life, is daunting.  You‚Äôre very brave Veera.  I love you,‚Äù he told her earnestly.  She couldn‚Äôt help purring in reply.

‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù

‚ÄòWhile I do hate to interject, as this seems like the sort of moment that would result in a long session of kissing before slumber‚Ä¶there is something we should discuss,‚Äô Io informed them, immediately getting their attention with her serious tone. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on Io?‚Äù  Winters asked, holding his gauntlet a bit higher so she could look them in the eye.  Her outfit had changed back to the barbarian armor from the festival, complete with face and body paint in some sort of deciduous forest camouflage scheme.  Winters couldn‚Äôt help raising a brow at her.

‚ÄòYour comment about adapting to this planet reminded me of it.  I had planned to not mention this at all, since I wasn‚Äôt sure, but I‚Äôve been processing your suit‚Äôs sensor data from this evening and I believe that my hypothesis is correct now that I have two separate corroborating incidents.‚Äô  Winters and Veera looked at one another, confused and a little worried at the VI‚Äôs cryptic words.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this about Io?  Is this why you asked to stay home?‚Äù  Winters prodded.   

‚ÄòNow before you accuse me of lying, I did review the information from Veera‚Äôs blood sample first.  However I did also want to isolate and review the sensor data from last night with the intention of comparing it to whatever you brought home today, assuming you did indeed come home after dark, which you did.  I did not mention it because I didn‚Äôt want to worry you needlessly, either due to false positives or a lack of data.‚Äô

‚ÄúIo I believe we‚Äôre more than worried now.  How about you tell us what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù  Veera encouraged, immediately on edge from the moment Io had mentioned Winters‚Äô nighttime traveling.

‚ÄòOf course Veera, I apologize.  Look at this.‚Äô  Io snapped her fingers and a small circle appeared next to her, surrounded by bars that radiated from the center, moving up and down seemingly at random.  To Winters it looked like some sort of basic waveform visualizer for music.

‚ÄúWhat is this Io?‚Äù  He asked with curiosity.  He‚Äôd never seen something like it on his HUD before.

‚ÄòThis is a little something I‚Äôve been working on over the last couple of days, sir.  My hypothesis necessitated an accumulation and simplification of all of the sensors present in the Aegis.  What you see before you is a representation of the combined readings of all of your external sensors: infrared, motion trackers, visual, audio, and all the rest,‚Äô Io gestured grandly at the graphic, clearly proud of her work.  As far as Winters was concerned she had every right to be, though he didn‚Äôt see how such a synthesis would be capable of telling them anything that the individual sensors couldn‚Äôt.  Veera had clearly regained her sense of innocent curiosity as well, now that the subject had shifted to something other than the chemical composition of her body.

‚ÄúSo when these bars get larger, that‚Äôs an indication of‚Ä¶something?‚Äù  Veera asked.

‚ÄòIn a manner of speaking Veera.  Obviously the Lieutenant‚Äôs armor is constantly surrounded by things, so the peaks represent deviations from that background.  It‚Äôs the difference between the forest and, for instance, a chesko within the forest.‚Äô

‚ÄúI think I understand now,‚Äù Veera replied.  ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs this that we‚Äôre looking at right now?  It doesn‚Äôt seem very active.‚Äù

‚ÄòThat was my initial thought as well, but let me play it fully for you.  This is a time lapse representation of the readings I took the night of your moonlit confession,‚Äù Io said, causing Veera‚Äôs feathers to flutter wildly.  Winters planted a firm kiss on her lips before turning back to Io‚Äôs display, watching as the bars grew and shrank seemingly at random.  As Io replayed the sequence over and over, a process that took about a minute for each repetition, something beneath the surface of his thoughts stuck out.

‚ÄúVeera, do you feel like there‚Äôs something we‚Äôre missing here?  Like there‚Äôs a pattern but you can‚Äôt quite pick it out?‚Äù  He asked the other organic.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve lived in these forests the longest; I‚Äôd like to know what you think.‚Äù  Veera‚Äôs chest swelled with pride at his request.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt put a claw on it Russell, but I am in agreement.  This does not appear to be fully random.  My people sometimes refer to a phenomenon called ‚Äòdanger sense‚Äô.  You find tales of it mostly among hunters or other villagers who spend significant amounts of time outside of the walls and farms.  I‚Äôve felt it too.  They describe it as a sensation of foreboding.  Sometimes it‚Äôs rapid and fierce, other times it‚Äôs said to be something that creeps up on you over time.  It compels you to change what you‚Äôre doing, to find a new way home, or turn away from the direction you‚Äôre headed.  No one really knows what causes it, but I‚Äôm sure Thantis, Ratha, and Antoth could all tell you tales of it, either first-hand or stories they recall.  While I do not feel it right now, obviously, this strikes me as the same sort of thing,‚Äù Veera finished, looking up at her mate with a worried gaze that he returned.

‚ÄúMy people have something similar.  We call it a sixth sense.  As with your people it revolves around the idea that we, at some unconscious level, are aware of dangers that we might not otherwise detect.  Io, you said this was something you weren‚Äôt sure of.  What changed your mind?‚Äù  He asked the VI.  She looked grateful for the lead in.

‚ÄòSir, as I said earlier, your suit‚Äôs data from this evening gave me another sample to work with.  Here is what I‚Äôve isolated from tonight.‚Äô  Io overlaid a second set of bars around the ring.  The first, in white, remained in the background, while the new off-yellow bars began their dance.  Winters and Veera narrowed their eyes.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Russell, it‚Äôs harder to keep track of both at once,‚Äù Veera voiced her opinion.

‚ÄúAgreed.  Io, is there any way you can clean this up for us?‚Äù

‚ÄòYes sir.‚Äô  Io waved her hands and paused certain arcs of the circle, drawing their attention to the pieces that were still moving.  ‚ÄòThis portion of the information is, indeed, truly indiscriminate.  Let me play both nights for you again.‚Äô  As she did so, Winters and Veera were able to see that the bars that Io had allowed to move did so more or less randomly.  Once she was satisfied that they understood, Io reversed the situation, pausing the elements that had been established as random and playing only a handful of single bars and groups of bars.  ‚ÄòNow look at these elements,‚Äô Io instructed.  Veera and Winters‚Äô eyes went wide as they noticed those particular bars behaving in similar manners, though occasionally with different magnitudes.

‚ÄúI can definitely see it now Io,‚Äù Winters said.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something that‚Äôs being picked up here, but it‚Äôs damn well hidden.‚Äù

‚ÄòIndeed sir.  That is my conclusion as well,‚Äô Io replied with a grim look on her face.  Veera had brought a hand to her mouth and was looking at Winters with great fear in her eyes.

‚ÄúGods protect us,‚Äù she whispered.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of them.‚Äù  Winters reached out with his arm, allowing her to snuggle into his side.  She clung to him tightly, not in the manner of one afraid for herself, but as one afraid of loss.  

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking at an ursae, aren‚Äôt I Io?‚Äù  He growled.

‚ÄòUnless there is another large predator prowling these woods with extraordinary stealth capabilities, I believe that is the logical conclusion sir.  For the last two nights at least, you have been followed,‚Äô Io informed him, visibly upset that something would dare stalk her partner.

‚ÄúRatha said they can grow to be absolutely massive.  You‚Äôre telling me something potentially larger than a grown elephant is barely showing up on our sensors?  What the hell are they made of?!‚Äù  Winters cursed, unable to believe the implications.

‚ÄòI do not know sir, but whatever this thing is has kept its distance.  Perhaps it can even detect that it‚Äôs being surveyed by the Aegis and is adjusting its behavior accordingly?  The only thing that I can say with any certainty is that something is out there and it‚Äôs stalking you, sir.‚Äô

‚ÄúDo any of these readings show up during the day?‚Äù  Winters asked, feeling a small but steady drip of adrenaline even though he was safe behind twelve foot palisade.

‚ÄòNo sir, that was the first thing I checked for when I detected this pattern.  I do not see anything like it during daylight hours,‚Äô Io confirmed.

‚ÄúWell, on the one hand, that makes me feel a bit better because we have some time to work with when I‚Äôm on the hunt now.  On the other hand, this behavior pattern matches what we‚Äôve learned so far about the ursae, and I am definitely not thrilled about the idea of them hunting us,‚Äù Winters concluded, drawing a small squeak from Veera.  He rubbed her shoulder and laid his head atop hers, gently reassuring her.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be careful.  I promise.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still going to go though,‚Äù Veera replied sadly.  

‚ÄúI have to Veera.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo you don‚Äôt!  We‚Ä¶we have enough dato I think, we can try to-‚Äù

‚ÄúShh, feather kitten.  Please.  I can‚Äôt let you starve or live in poverty when I can do something about it.  I refuse to let us be that way,‚Äù he tried to reassure her with iron determination.

‚ÄúI would rather be hungry than alone,‚Äù Veera whispered, causing his chest to tighten in that painful way that circumvented any source of physical trauma.  ‚ÄúI would rather sleep with you each night than with a blanket made of hyrven.  I‚Äôm scared,‚Äù she admitted freely.  For the briefest of moments, Winters thought of agreeing.  In the end, he shook his head vehemently.

‚ÄúVeera, I have the will and, more importantly, the ability to kill every last thing in that forest and survive it.  I will not see you suffer again if I can help it.  I will come home.  I made you a promise.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo did he!‚Äù  She sobbed quietly into his chest, quelling any further impulse he might have had for male bravado that evening.  After a short while Veera looked at Io.  ‚ÄúPlease keep him safe.‚Äù

‚ÄòYou have my word Veera.‚Äô  Io bowed to them, showing she was serious.  ‚ÄòThough we will not intentionally remain in the forest after dark, nor go hunting for ursae,‚Äô she said, shooting a warning look at Winters.  ‚ÄòI know what to look for now if the fates conspire against us.  Any further incidents will only help perfect my ability to detect whatever this is.  For now it appears content to watch.  That will prove to be a fatal mistake.‚Äô

‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm glad you two are so confident,‚Äù Veera replied, drying her eyes.  ‚ÄúSorry Russell, I just had a moment there.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre allowed as many of those as you like or need Veera, but you‚Äôre not allowed to be sorry for them,‚Äù he insisted.

‚ÄúI just wish there was something I could do for you,‚Äù Veera confessed, her contemplative look accentuated as their fire slowly died and allowed the chill of late autumn to permeate the room.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already been doing that Veera,‚Äù Winters assured her.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you went with me on the hunt, I‚Äôd be worried sick over you.  You have nothing to protect you like I have in the Aegis.  I‚Äôd be focused more on protecting you than actually killing game.  Forgive me if this sounds‚Ä¶too male‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs wonderful coming home to a warm fire or tea.  It puts my mind at ease knowing that whatever crazy stuff I manage to acquire out there, you know how to turn that into things we need like salt, or vegetables, or even bloody furniture!‚Äù  They shared a small laugh at that as he continued.  ‚ÄúIt meant more than you probably realize coming home tonight and seeing that you‚Äôd been trying to learn English all on your own.  You make this place worth coming back to, and you‚Äôre doing things that have to be done in order to keep us both alive this winter.  I want you to keep doing those things feather kitten.  You can worry over me while you do them, but I made my promise.  I‚Äôll be keeping it.‚Äù  After a moment Veera nodded against him.

‚ÄúDo the women of your species get mad at things like that?‚Äù  She asked after a time.  Her question gave Winters pause.

‚ÄúWhere did that come from?‚Äù  

‚ÄúYou asked me to forgive you.  What would I forgive you for?  You told me you‚Äôre prepared to risk your life to feed us and make our lives more comfortable and asked that I continue making this space of ours into a home for the both of us.  That seems like the most natural thing in the world Russell.  I take no shame whatsoever in being your mate,‚Äù she informed him resolutely, crawling onto his lap and reminding him that she was very much his woman.  With brief apologies to Io, Winters returned his gauntlet to the foot of the bed before kissing his Cauthan tenderly, bringing a hand to her cheek and the other around her waist.  The fiery passion of the previous night simmered under the surface, but Veera clearly sought to convey something softer and deeper to him.  With ease and care, he held her to him and laid them both down on the bed.  Neither paid any heed to the already late hour.  With the hunt looming ahead of them, sleep was the last thing on their minds.  Instead they continued their kiss, slowly and lovingly exploring one another.  Winters ran his hands along Veera‚Äôs arms as she rested atop him, moving on to explore her spine, running his fingertips down and over her dress and building a tactile picture of her in his mind.  She was doing the same, allowing her hands to roam over his shoulders and arms before traveling to his muscled flanks.  Her touch was perfect to him, not hard and needy, but not light and hesitant either.  It simply was.  He had allowed her space, and she was enacting the lesson he‚Äôd taught her the night before.  ‚ÄúI like the way your body feels.  There‚Äôs no secrets, no rounded edges.  It‚Äôs like I can be closer to you,‚Äù she murmured, tilting her body to the side so she could bring her left hand across his abdominal muscles.  Her purr was music to his ears as his own hands traveled lower, finding her dress again riding up in the small of her back.  Taking the opportunity presented to him, he slipped his hands underneath it, running his fingers through the fur of her back and pressing firmly enough to feel the contour of her muscles and vertebrae.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get bored of touching you like this Veera.  You and your fur feel wonderful, stripes and all.‚Äù  He kissed her again, leaving tender pecks along her muzzle.  A single tear fell onto his face, causing him to open his eyes and gaze into Veera‚Äôs captivating irises, shimmering in the darkness that the fire had left behind.  

‚ÄúI prayed to the gods,‚Äù she whispered back, nipping and pecking his own lips and bringing her paws to his face.  ‚ÄúI prayed that I would live long enough to see the man you really are.‚Äù

‚ÄúVeera‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI will pray every day for your safe return,‚Äù she promised, shedding another tear.  Winters brought his arms up to hold her to him, reaching all the way up to grasp her shoulders under her dress.  

‚ÄúThank you my love‚Ä¶for everything.‚Äù  He hugged her tightly, resting his chin in the cradle of her neck.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve needed great strength in the last cycles, and you‚Äôve given it to me.‚Äù  He said no more, knowing that Veera would understand his meaning.  For a time they simply continued to kiss, neither rushed nor lustful, keeping each other warm as a slight chill worked its way past the door and through the walls.  Every surface and curve of their upper bodies was explored tenderly in the darkness, with the two only passing into sleep a few hours before dawn.

\-----

‚ÄúI wish we could stay like this forever,‚Äù Veera whispered as she rested her head on Winters‚Äô chest.  Seil had risen long ago, but the two of them had decided to spend the hours of early daylight in bed.  Winters didn‚Äôt mind at all.  

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs peaceful, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù  He replied, running his fingers through her feathers and remembering the prior night with fondness.  His hunger was growing though, and it finally compelled him to rise.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll build us a fire before I go.  It doesn‚Äôt seem to be warming up much.  Are you going to spend the day here?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think I should see what I can find in the forest?‚Äù  Veera asked, feeling a bit unsure at the idea of staying home all day.

‚ÄúI guess that‚Äôs a decent point.  Plenty of time for learning once we‚Äôre snowed in, yeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly.  Here now, eat.‚Äù  Veera insisted, handing Winters a kina to go with the fish and eggs he‚Äôd already taken.  He looked at her with thanks before setting himself on the ground for a late breakfast.  Once their morning rituals were complete, Veera helped him into his armor, making sure to avoid the brutal serrated tips of the two arrows that Winters had attached to the plating of his left arm.  They were made of some dark patterned material with a certain amount of gloss to it.  Figuring she likely wouldn‚Äôt understand much of it even if she asked, she ignored them and made sure that her human took everything with him that could be used to kill a potential aggressor.  The only thing he left behind was the firearm he‚Äôd used at the funeral service for his comrades, a weapon he referred to as a rifle.  When Veera asked, he explained that his pistol possessed more stopping power and was easier to use in the event of a close quarters confrontation with any sort of hungry predator.  Satisfied, she allowed it to stay, resting in the corner of their home.  When Winters was dressed in all but his helmet she reached up to kiss him, wrapping her arms around his neck and refusing to let go for a long moment.  He tasted delightfully of mint.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt forget my promise Veera.  Be safe out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will my darling, you do the same.  Take care of him Io.‚Äù

‚ÄòI will use every tool at my disposal to ensure our safe return Veera.  As the Lieutenant said, please be careful yourself.  I know you will not be venturing as far, and that you‚Äôll be headed south, but even so we will worry for you.‚Äô  Veera looked up at Winters, searching his blue eyes for a long moment.

‚ÄúThere are so many things I want to say to you,‚Äù she started, not even knowing how to put the emotions into words.

‚ÄúI feel the same way, and I suspect that no amount of rushed conversation would be enough.  So let‚Äôs both get back safe, alright?  No heroics.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhile picking herbs, Russell?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, you never know right?‚Äù  He shrugged and smiled at her, a genuine display that warmed her from the inside.

‚ÄúI suppose so.  Come now darling, let‚Äôs be on our way,‚Äù she insisted, taking his hand and leading him out into the street where they were greeted by a crisp blue sky and the golden light of the changing seasons.  After a final tender kiss that had her tail waving with happiness, Veera said goodbye and watched her human turn and make for the west gate, sword and shield on his back and bow in hand.  She didn‚Äôt think he looked like Kel, but she was sure anything that got in his way would feel otherwise.  After a brief moment of consideration she ducked back inside and knelt before her small shrine, entreating the gods to ensure their safe return.  ‚ÄúSelah, Russell.‚Äù

"The way I see it, using your time productively Is the best way to live. There‚Äôs nothing quite like going to bed satisfied, knowing that you‚Äôve accomplished a heap of work, and waking up excited to tackle the day every morning. Really puts a tingle in your balls. Wasting time, and spending most of it in the mental equivalent of first gear, in my experience, is the fastest way to dissatisfaction, lack of direction,  and even depression \(obvious exceptions apply for those suffering from serious disorders\). It‚Äôs never been easier to waste time than it is today: Most young people spend half the day glued to their phone or computer screen, scrolling through Instagram, trawling Youtube to find the least \(perhaps most?\) mind\-numbing content they can. And I‚Äôve been guilty of it as well: I can shamefully admit that I‚Äôve clicked on videos with clickbait titles like ‚Äúeverything fell apart‚Äù or ‚Äúgreatest day ever‚Äù when I had literally no idea who the content creator was. We live in an age where attention is an invaluable asset and there is constant competition by social media companies and the like to capture it. But, there‚Äôs two sides to every coin: It may be easier than ever to waste time, but it‚Äôs also easier than ever to be productive with our time. We have an extraordinary number of resources available at the push of a button, and the potential efficiency of any particular endeavour is through the roof. However, to begin using our time efficiently, we must first analyse where it‚Äôs being wasted.

# 3 kinds of time.

To do this, I divide my time into 3 categories: Active time, passive time, and dead time.

**Active time**: This is the time you spend, you guessed it, being active. Working out, working, writing, directly moving towards your goals. This is your most productive segment of time.

**Passive time**: This is less productive, but still necessary. This is the time you spend unwinding from periods of active time. Resting from the gym, taking a break during study, taking that much needed breather at the end of a long day. This amount of time can be minimised for maximum efficiency, but there‚Äôs a certain point where efficiency drops and you‚Äôre taking too little time to unwind. Passive time is necessary, as it allows you to work at peak efficiency during active periods.

**Dead time**: This time is completely wasted. It‚Äôs the time you spend vegged out on the couch watching re\-runs of Family Guy or playing Candy Crush not because you need a break mentally, but because you‚Äôre disengaged from the world and putting off work that you could be going. This is the time you need to eliminate.

Now, it takes a certain degree of self\-honesty to distinguish between passive and active time at times. Some days, you‚Äôre going to need more time to relax than others, but it‚Äôs very easy to slip from necessary relaxation into time\-wasting potato mode. For this reason, I suggest choosing a maximum length of time to spend resting between periods of activity. Personally, I‚Äôd advise starting with an hour\-long timer. If you feel burned out after a week spending no more than an hour relaxing at a time, consider upping it. If you approach it with the right mindset, however, you should generally have a high enough work capacity as a human being to make do with this amount of rest.

Dividing time like this isn‚Äôt inherently necessary, particularly for those who are busy enough not to have time to spare let alone waste, but for those who find time slipping away and being wasted, it is imperative that you understand where the time is going and put a stop to poor time management.

# Planning out the day

Making a list of the things I plan on accomplishing during the day has been huge in helping me increase my productivity. I‚Äôm never at a loss as to what to do at any given time, and the simple motivation of completing tasks is addictive. There‚Äôs also a sense of momentum involved: When I tick something off the list, I like to keep going and steamroll the rest of my tasks. There‚Äôs also the option of making a timetable for the day: I choose not to do this as I find it kills my momentum slightly having to finish a task prematurely before moving onto something else, but this may not be the case for everybody and is worth considering in many cases.

# Getting a jump on the day

I choose to wake up at 5:30, every single day \(barring the occasions when I have company\). Building the habit was gruelling and it‚Äôs still hard on some days, but it is well worth it. It does amazing things for my mood, allows me more control over my routine even with an inconsistent work schedule, prevents the afternoon slump that used to kill me every day, and most importantly, it allows me to get a jump on the day. When everybody else is beginning their work day, I can have a workout, meditation, stretching routine and breakfast completed, and already have momentum going for the rest of the day. My bedtime is 9 o‚Äôclock nightly, which can also be inconvenient, but building healthy habits is much easier when your sleep/wake cycle is consistent, and there‚Äôs new research coming out all the time that demonstrates the importance of a consistent bedtime and waketime. Going to bed early also helps cut out the generally unproductive time normally spent watching TV at night. There‚Äôs a reason the video of a Navy Seal recommending a wake time of 4:30am has blown up recently, and Hollywood juggernauts like Mark Wahlberg and the Rock recommend it.

# Increasing the value of your time-sinks.

To do this, you need to identify the things you waste most of your time on. I‚Äôll use a few examples: Say you waste 3 hours a day playing FIFA, or 3 hours scrolling reddit, or 3 hours on Youtube. Why not spend an hour playing FIFA, recording it, and then spending an hour or two editing and recording commentary? Why not spend an hour or two braintstorming and writing a Reddit post for your favourite sub? Why not find something you‚Äôre passionate about and make a Youtube video on it?

These scenarios may seem like a waste of time to many people either way, but it‚Äôs all in the value of building useful skills and having a tangible product at the end of it. Instead of spending your time taking in small amounts of information or getting a dopamine hit, you‚Äôre developing your video editing skills. You‚Äôre developing your writing style and formulating new ideas. You‚Äôre developing your creativity and your ability to express yourself verbally. You‚Äôre learning how to capture interest and promote yourself. Plus, you have a tangible product at the end. I‚Äôve been consistently drafting reddit posts daily and it gives me an enormous creative satisfaction to see them come to fruition and receive feedback on them. My writing style is improving and becoming less clunky, I‚Äôm formulating my ideas more efficiently, I‚Äôm giving other people ideas that potentially benefit them. This post isn‚Äôt about becoming a Harvey Spectre\-esque 80 hour work week machine overnight, it‚Äôs about making incremental changes to increase your overall productivity bit by bit. Sometimes the hardest time to be productive is when you have no reason to be: Perhaps you‚Äôve completely all your outstanding work and are left with ‚Äúfree time‚Äù.

# Keep track of your excuses.

The human mind is an awfully strange environment: Many people are caught in a cycle of excuse\-making followed by immediate regret. They then allow themselves to hamster away this regret, and make the exact same decision time and time again. Excuses are often very weak and obvious in hindsight, but can appear as legitimate reasoning before the fact. The technique I use for dealing with such excuses as this is very simple: Write down your excuses, with some conditions.

For example, if I find myself skipping the gym regularly, I can keep track of my legitimate reasons for going, as well as the completely unjustifiable bullshit my brain comes up with, putting them into two categories. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sore‚Äù can be followed up with conditions like ‚Äúdo you genuinely believe there‚Äôs a legitimate risk of injuring yourself based on this?‚Äù. Obviously, if I wake up with my back feeling awful it‚Äôs probably better to skip and not hurt myself, but if I‚Äôm just sore from the previous workout, I‚Äôm being lazy. Similar questions can be asked of things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired‚Äù, ‚ÄúI need to rest‚Äù, ‚ÄúI have things I have to do‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick‚Äù etc. Assess the situations in which these would be legitimate, and prepare your answers in advance. In the cold light of day, excuses are often laughably weak. It‚Äôs a similar phenomenon to waking up in the middle of the night reeling from a nightmare, falling back to sleep, and waking again in the morning wondering what the hell you were afraid of. Keeping track of your excuses is like receiving an advanced warning and being able to prepare for them. It‚Äôs an extremely valuable tool, and has pretty much completely cut out skipping my priorities.

# Conclusion

Now, I shouldn‚Äôt have to disclaim this because this subreddit is full of adults who can make their own choices, but these are simply tips. Feel free to employ as many or as few of these as you wish. They‚Äôre simply techniques which have improved my ability to work towards my goals far more effectively and not be stuck in a cycle of regret and self\-deprecation cause I can‚Äôt motivate myself to get to work to save my life.

"So excited to write this because it was not expecting it. I created the throwaway because I'm pretty much telling no one and I want to shout it from the rooftops! Over the last two years I aggressively built a real estate portfolio that, as of this month, nets me a little over $5,000/month and my family's fixed expenses are about $4,000/month. I don't know why but I expected this kind of milestone to be marked by some kind of satisfying moment like in the movies where something happens and it just clicks, BOOM. That didn't happen at all. I received my monthly owner distributions, plugged everything into my profit and loss statements and then forgot about it. It wasn't until a couple weeks later that I realized the net income exceeded all of my expenses and even then it didn't really click, it was pretty anticlimactic to be honest. I don't feel different, I'm not going to change any of my habits or stop my investing. This is just a fun realization that at this point, I have freedom to do whatever if I so desire. There is some serious power in that realization at 27 years old.

Regarding how I built my real estate portfolio I used a couple leverage techniques that worked well for me. The first two properties I bought \(a fourplex and a duplex\) were purchased using conventional loans with 25&#37; downpayments. After that, I bought single family houses for cash that were in disrepair, foreclosures, etc. Those houses were purchased well below market value and since I fixed them up, I could take out a mortgage that was adjusted to the new value of the home after I made the repairs. Simple math, I buy a house for $20,000 and put $10,000 into it. My $30,000 of investment made the house worth about $45,000 and then I would take out an 80&#37; loan on the new value. I get all my money back plus another couple grand \(yes, I got paid to buy the house\) and a tenant pays the mortgage for me. Rinse and repeat. On Biggerpockets they call this the BRRR method, Buy Rehab Rent Refinance.

Houses are typically bought for $20,000\-$40,000 and I end up putting $5,000\-$20,000 worth of work into rehabs. All my houses cashflow $150\-$300/month and are all located in the midwest.

Still too excited to know what to do with this milestone except keep going!",83,1527814513.0,8nk0yu,86,This month I achieved FI,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8nk0yu/this_month_i_achieved_fi/,2018-05-31 20:55:13

"[GoogleDoc Campaign Log Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D5I1R0AvNgovM0pz5JFi-RLgg8ePE6TB2uIOaH_xH_I/edit?usp=sharing)

Hey there fellow DMs,

this is a template I made for campaign management documents. It provides an outline for a detailed session logs, for crafting plots and detailed plot points or scenes.

I used to have multiple terribly formated docs to ""organise"" all the things needed for play. Few months ago I finally had the time to really organise all my notes, make a GoogleDocs format template in the 5e phb style and throw together this campain log template. I've since used it in two games and tweaked it a little. And now I want to share it with the community which inspiered me to make this thing.


Hopefully some of you find this usefull or inspiringand. I'd love to hear your feedback on it.


Note: I've translated it best I can, but I've probably missed somethings, so feel free to comment on that(in the doc as well).

"Near the start of my campaign the party were in an epic battle (think of Helms Deep) defending a city from an army of Orcs.

The party had been fighting alongside a Dwarf named **Wolvar Dragonbeard**, a savage fighter with years of experience.

One of my Party was a Half-Orc named **Grunklestan**, and even though it was his own kin he was fighting he swore to protect the people.

&nbsp;

During the battle the air grew silent, the Orcs began to chant and clash their swords to their shields. Suddenly **Thousands of Zombies** came sprinting out of the forest towards the city.

Grunklestan having experienced first hand the ferocious nature of these zombies ordered the Party to retreat.

The Party ran towards the gates of the city, fighting of Orcs along their way when they heard a roar from behind them ... it was Wolvar

*""Help! My leg is stuck, I can't move!""*

&nbsp;

The zombies were closing in, I told the party within a few moments they would be overrun and would surely die.

Grunklestan without a moments hesitation **ran back to save Wolvar**

&nbsp;

Grunklestan freed Wolvar's leg, revealing that **his leg was shattered** and instead of leaving him to die picked him up and carried him over his shoulder.

The rest of the party covered Grunklestan and Wolvar and after a very impressive Athletics check from Grunklestan they had made it through the gates.

&nbsp;

Wolvar was astonished: *""Why would you risk yer own skin for a Dwarf like me?""*

Grunklestan replied: *""If we're gonna win this war we'll need to do it together""*

&nbsp;

Years pass in game and the world is a very different place. 

Grunklestan had learned recently that his uncle **Roshak** had been killed in battle over a year ago.
 
The party were sent to investigate an abandoned mine where some scouts had disappeared. They got to the mine where they were ambushed by Orcs on horses.

&nbsp;

Emerging from the orcs was no other than **Roshak** himself. Grunklestan was in shock, the uncle and nephew embraced each other. 

Grunklestan said *""I don't understand, I thought you were dead""*

&nbsp;

Roshak led the party inside the mines, he told them that he was badly injured in battle and was bleeding out when a Dwarf dragged him off the battlefield and saved him.

His name was **Wolvar Dragonbeard**.

&nbsp;

Wolvar said:

 *""Long ago an Orc saved me in the middle of battle when he could've left me for dead, I thought I'd return the favor""*

"I work at a small cafe, and it‚Äôs just a breakfast lunch place. We only stay open till 3pm. So At 2:15 a party of 10 walk in, and so it‚Äôs no problem and we start to set it up in our garden area, and as soon as it was set and ready to go a man from the party comes over and says ‚ÄúI know that‚Äôs not for us ‚Äú I look to him and reply ‚Äúyes, is something wrong‚Äù he then sighs and says ‚Äúwe usually prefer to sit in the back‚Äù I tell him ‚Äúit‚Äôs almost closing time and the back is closed‚Äù to which he groans and says ‚Äúfine‚Äù. The hostess seats them and gets the drink order. And I give em a little time to look at the menu before I go over, and then I see the same man waving at me so I walk over and ask if they‚Äôre ready to order to which he replies ‚Äúwell yeah you guys are about to close‚Äù so I just ignore his comment and take the groups order everybody else at the table is just as rude With the tone and seemed to sound entitled. So I thank them take the menus and hang the checks. 

Food comes out and everything seems well. I check on them and see how everything was and everyone seemed pleased. Man eats all his food and says his steak was under cooked and how he wants another. I tell him  that had he told me prior to eating it in entirety I could have fixed it too his liking and apologized but there wasn‚Äôt anything more I could do. I then returned with the check and he takes it. (His check was for 108$) he then pays his check and they wait by the front door for a couple people to use the restroom and what not, I went to see if they had tipped and they hadn‚Äôt so I look towards the front and the wife was standing at the candy jar we have, grabbing all the different kinds, so I walk over and grab the jar from her Without saying a word.

"[This is the article I'm referring to.](https://kayleneyoder.com/prepare-for-your-husband-sex/)

TL;DR, she gives 3 ways to prepare for your marriage bed: 

1) Prepare mentally, by texting him something flirty, looking through pictures, or thinking about good qualities of him. 

2) Prepare physically, by showering, shaving, and wearing something pretty. 

3) Prepare initiation, so your husband won't feel as though he is imposing on you. 

None of these are wrong, but it just kills me that there are *married women* who need this advice. And the whole tone of the article is assuming this is something your husband needs you to do for him, it never takes into account women's sexual needs. It only talks about it as something you *have* to do so that your man won't go wandering into the arms of a temptress.

I was raised in an extremely conservative area, but I've never been taught this. Even though I was told to wait for marriage, I'm at least thankful I was taught it's normal to want and enjoy sex. My heart hurts for women who still think this way and feel like sex is supposed to be a chore. I'd love to hear what you guys think about it.",30,1527810130.0,8njfhd,102,I just found a blog post about ways to prepare for sex with your husband.

"Like the title says I had a pretty shitty day yesterday and I need to build something new. I haven't kept up to date with current PC technology in a while so I'm asking for help on making sure I picked the right parts together.


Alright so huge edit. I want to clarify that I do have a good living situation, have clothes, food, gas money etc. all covered. I do some graphics work in Photoshop for a small game project so this is part of getting some income as well. Removed all the Amazon stuff and adding an updated build.

"I'm living in Brookline, MA as At-Will Tenants with no lease or any other agreement in place besides that we are living here and paying him rent. He has paid all utilities while I have lived here. (He had some baddies that the coppers arrested living in the house before we moved in, so he had to drop the rent a lot to get anyone interested in the place)  
Short:  
Our Gas (and thus Hot Water) is shut off, due to the landlord not paying. Gas company won't let me pay or even look at the overdue bill, and didn't give 30 day notice. I gave the landlord notice that if he did not have the gas on by today, we would be withholding rent. The gas is still off.  
**How much can I withhold?**

Long: (it gets a little weird)  
This is the second month in a row that the landlords actions have resulted in a lack of utilities. Last month was heat, but we resolved that in a fair way (My roommates and I payed 1/4 the value of the apartment for the duration we lacked heating). We contacted the Health inspectors and they came out and put a fire under him to get the heat on.  

This month our gas (and thus Hot water) was shut off because he did not pay the gas bill They did not send a 30 day notice of the shut off. Two weeks later it is still off.  
Here's what we've done:  
*Called and written to him several times to turn it on.  
He says it's paid and he called them to come turn it on.  
*Called the gas company to pay the overdue bill and/or to have them turn it on.  
They've been really confusing. They said there was no shutoff notice and that the account is up to date. When I scheduled to have them come out and turn it on, the guy showed up and said he was only contracted for emergencies and that he couldn't turn it on. When I called the next day they said they could not give me the details of the account and could not come out to turn the gas on.  
*Had a state health inspector come by (same one as before).  
This is where it's really weird. He said that the person we are paying rent to no longer owns the property, and that he fined the company that now owns the property. This is the first time I've heard this, the company that allegedly owns the property hasn't sent notices or any information at all that we should be paying them instead and the landlord hasn't mentioned this at all.  

In the mean time I've been going to the gym to take showers and my roommates are out in the cold.  

Should I withhold all rent (and set it aside in an escrow thingy) until the gas is on?  
Should I withhold partial rent for time without utilities?  
Should I withhold rent until the owner of the property is settled?  
Should I withhold rent and express that it will be withheld until the issue is settled in court?  

P.S. Sorry this is so long. But I'm also planning on contacting the Department of public utilities tomorrow to report the gas company and hopefully force something out.   

**Edit2:  i sent him a notice informing him we would not be paying rent this month, he's called the gas company and they've already come out and turned it on.  Now I have to figure out whether I hold out and follow through and not pay this month and force court action, or just withhold an amount equal to the distress he's caused us.  I really dont like this guy, but i also just want to live comfortably and peaceably in my own apartment**

What you can use this for:

 * Test your dream set.
 * Test against a boss to get better at it.
 * Test you own weapon ideas (Yes you will be able to make any armor/ability/weapon/ring you want).
 * Just having fun with setting stats really high or see what happens with -14 dex.

"This is a serious question regarding fandom and a dying person (not me, I'm fine). It's not a subject I'm bringing here without reservations. If this is too depressing or squicks you out  I totally understand that. You can skip this post; no hard feelings.

I know someone who's dying of ALS. If you don't know what that is, you can go here for details: https://www.als.ca/about-als/what-is-als/ It's bad. I mean confined-to-bed, ventilator, and feeding tube bad. I don't know her personally, but she's a good friend of a good friend, and that counts in my book.

Here's the thing: she's a huge Avengers movie fan. Avengers 4 is slated to come out in 2019 and probably she won't be here for it.


A buddy of mine tried to start a Twitter chain to alert various celebrities and groups in the hope that they will let her in on how the movie ends/general plotline/possible clips. You can read the post here: https://twitter.com/RobinWolfraim/status/1000899727121100803 and search #spoilersforchantelle if you want more.  Please contact the original twitter poster for additional information on Chantelle, what this is about, and how you could help.  Even a retweet would be appreciated.


The lady in question is not able to travel anywhere. None of us have cash to throw at this nor do I want to raise random funds with no clear direction on what to use them for. She's an adult so there's no ""make-a-wish"" option here. I have no idea if Marvel or Disney would be willing to risk spoiler leaks or if this is even feasible, but we're gonna try.

We're in the process of sending emails and letters to both Disney and Marvel.  If you wish to send a request on her behalf yourself, you can find the links on their contact page here: https://www.thewaltdisneycompany.com/contact-us/  
Please contact the original twitter poster, Robin, for details if you wish to do so before you send.


This feels like a thing the internet can group-source, but I have no idea how this could be accomplished. The clock is ticking and if this is gonna happen in any form, it's gotta happen soon.

"One of my favorite brands, personally. The deep, rich, smoky flavor really brings out the best in whiskey. Pretty top-shelf but worth every penny. Some people prefer lighter stuff, but in my opinion a good Lagavulin beats out any competitors.

Lagavulin (Whiskey - Power)

Cost: ~~Your braincells~~

Become intoxicated. Enjoy an aged whiskey.

Wiki Link: https://www.malts.com/en-us/our-whisky-collection/lagavulin/

Is it a good drink? A bad drink? Would you only order it when you're in a specific mood? Should the brewers try something different for this drink? Comment below!

^^It's ^^a ^^joke ^^please ^^don't ^^hurt ^^me

Lagavulin (Elite - Act 1)

Attacks:

Sleep (Does this for 3 turns before waking up, gains 8 block every turn, alternatively wakes up if it takes HP Damage)

Attack (18 Damage)

Siphon Soul (Removes 1 Strength and 1 Dexterity from you)

Wiki Link: http://slay-the-spire.wikia.com/wiki/Lagavulin

*[Previous Discussion: Carnage](https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/8nbbae/daily_discussiondebate_103_carnage/)*
Conclusion: It's just a straight out solid card. Good damage and self-removes from your deck if you don't want it. Can conflict with other high cost cards in your deck, however, and is hard to play when running 3 energy (As most higher cost cards are).

"Basically put. So far Paradox has put the topic of Slavery and Genocide into the very subtle background or remove them outright in their historical games.

It's there but you need to look very carefully. Like how the Culture Conversion works in EUIV or being a raiding nomad in CK2. Even Victoria 2 downplays the role of Slavery and Ethnic Cleansing in that historical time period.

I do hope they will not gloss over it again in Imperator:Rome as the age of Antiquity is filled with slavery and massacres. 

One must have the opportunity to hate flithy barbarians and rebels and go ""Carthago delenda est"" on a troublesome region or kill the men and enslave the rest.

"I don‚Äôt know if this belongs here, so bare with me. Also fair warning, this is pretty long and mentions racist comments about WW2. You might want to skip this if you are uncomfortable with that. 
Ok, Lately I‚Äòve been thinking about Middle School and the assholes that I shared a class with.

There was one student in particular, lets call him Dirtbag McDoucheface, who bullied several people over the years. (Destroyed property of other students, constantly smeared meat paste all over a vegetarian kids seat, beat shorter kids etc.)

One day, my history teacher at the time decided, that we were old enough for her to take us on an excursion to an old concentration camp from WW2. Teachers with classes in 7. and 8. grade did this so we would learn about our part in the war and the impact it had. I can only describe the atmosphere as..devastating (as one might suspect). It‚Äòs a very heavy, unsettling silence all around and everything just seems..colder. But I digress.

When our teacher announced this, Dirtbag leaned to a girl in front of him and said (I quote this because I haven‚Äòt forgotten it to this day) ‚ÄúYou probably shouldn‚Äòt go there, they lock people like you in a chamber and kill you‚Äú. Now to say that to anybody is horrible enough, but this girl...This girl is a Jew. Me and the people that overheared that were so shocked, nobody was able to say anything. We watched her silently cry her eyes out during class. Our group comforted her and convinced her to report that shit to the teacher. She was livid, gave him detention, a shit load of extra homework, made him write a three page long apology to my poor classmate, and instantly called his parents that she needs to have a talk with them. Now someone else might have given him this punishment and banned him from joining the excursion. Well, that would have been too simple for our awesome teacher. He wouldn‚Äòt have learned his lesson. And this is were things get awesome.

Our teacher, bless her, made a deal with the parents. He could join our class...but a parent had to be with him at all times during our excursion at the concentration camp and never leave him out of sight. So imagine the big, bad, oh so mighty Dirtbag McDoucheface being forced to hold his mommy‚Äôs hand in front of the whole class for three hours. Probably the worst thing that could happen to a teenager who wants to be feared by his peers. Everybody started mocking him after this. Soon enough, the whole school knew about this shithead and what he‚Äòd done. Even his (usually asshole) friends only talked to him to make fun of him and call him names after this for _years_. I really hope he will never live this down.",7,1527827059.0,8nlra8,114,Be a cruel asshole?

People are citing the fact that since this thread was posted a few hours before the reveal of Fallout 76, then he must have some insider information. However, this is not the case.

In fact, ""Fallout 76"" has been around as a rumor since [December 28, 2017](https://boards.fireden.net/v/thread/401449791/#401465240) when it was posted on 4Chan's /V/ board.

Sorry they may not be scams but they are definitely not decentralized

*Leaders in the community acting like wallstreet dicks? 
I have to read Charlie praising Tapjets a company that rents fucking private jets, for their crypto payment implementation. Ver doesn't need explaining.  The rest going to NYC and partying at $2000 a head conventions.....Da fuck?

*Rampant market manipulation?
Ok crypto may have been built on this but its blatantly systematic now! The hope of institutional money coming in was to help legitimize crypto markets..... foreseeable backfire there.

*Community that values ""the tech"" over lambos?
Many from the early community cashed out during the boom and were replaced by get rich hopers. Trying to have a conversation with some people on something thats wrong besides Charts and Price is getting harder and harder.

I know this is probably destined for the depths of the red sea, but come on people think of what this technology can do and how it was offered first to the masses.

"This discussion is about US politics.  \(Sorry\)  And there's a wall of text. \(Double sorry\)

I believe that there's a lot of inefficiencies and odd quirks in the US election system.  For me, one of the biggest, most glaring pieces of weirdness is the fact that candidates can have money coming in from people who will never be their constituents.  The candidates should not, in my opinion, be able to receive donations from anybody who will not reside in their district, including entities headquartered elsewhere.  I have a few reasons for thinking this:

1st, we have established that we do not want outside influence in our elections.  It is already illegal to accept money and help from foreign governments and entities during an election.  No matter how much of a stake they may have in the US, they are not to help any campaign, because we've decided that we do not want somebody else having an impact on our elections.  I feel that this is a smaller, but similar issue, having somebody who doesn't live there influence the election is just as unideal.

2nd, the people who make these contributions do not necessarily care about the constituency.  They typically care about advancing some sort of agenda, for instance having D/R control of the government, or electing a certain type of candidate. Whether or not their chosen candidate is a good fit for that state, district, or whatever, is not required to be high on the donor's priority list.  Because the whole point of these elected officials is to represent the voters, I feel this is not a good situation we often create for ourselves.

3rd, it allows people from rich areas of the country to ""talk over"" people from poor areas of the country.  Even if a candidate is running only on individual donations, if they are getting an influx of cash from donors in California or New York, they can buy a disproportionate amount of airtime in an area with a low cost of living.

4th, these non\-local donors already have representation.  They do not need, nor are they entitled to, any more.  With this exception of folks living in the territories \(a whole other discussion, outside the scope of this CMV\) everybody has 2 senators, 1 representative, and 1 president at the federal level.

5th, it becomes possible that this candidate is now beholden to interests irrelevant or contrary to his/her constituents.   
 Likewise, this may obligate them to spend a tremendous amount of fundraising time outside of their constituency, which is an irrelevant waste of time for their constituents who deserve vigorous representation.

6th, the opposite of the 5th point, it makes far too many people into ""stakeholders"".  Because anybody can get involved, elections that should be about local issues can become painful slogs to see who can dump the most money into a candidate.  As such, there's an absurd amount of opinions from utterly irrelevant people confusing the situation.

7th, the influx of money makes politics annoying and inaccessible for voters.  I can only offer an anecdote here, but I grew up in Pennsylvania, a perpetual swing state, and moved to Atlanta right after the 2016 election.  After a year and a half of nonstop political ads, my new hometown had the Georgia 6th election, and I spent what felt like another eternity unable to go 5 minutes without hearing another goddamn ad for Jon Ossof or Karen Handel.  It was an utterly inconsequential election, between two horrifically milquetoast candidates, neither of whom had strong opinions about anything.  This process, frankly, made me hate even the thought of another election the same way people in Florida hate lovebug season.

This is not about super PAC's.  A super PAC could still exist under this system, but they'd only be able to contribute to candidates that could represent their entire donor base in office.  So, a PAC with entirely Texan donors could only support Ted Cruz or Beto O'Rourke for senate in 2018.  Donors from other states wouldn't be allowed, because neither of them will represent their state.

Also, I recognize that some people have interests in multiple areas, for instance people who live in New Jersey but work in New York City.  But we don't allow them to vote in both elections,and they shouldn't be allowed to buy influence in both elections, period.

Regarding national parties, or national charities/special interests, they should only be involved in the presidential election.  Done.  The local chapter of the NRA or ACLU might be able to donate towards a candidate that represents their district, but not the national organization.

Enforcement is not in the scope of this CMV.  I don't know how this would be enforced, but that's not the point.

And I realize that people in US territories are in unusual situation.  They're a separate issue.

What would change my view?  If you show me some sort of evidence that contributing to races for candidates who don't represent you in congress somehow either A\) makes that candidate's district/state better or B\) leads to greater voter enfranchisement.  If you're going to quote a study, or some data, please show your work.  Thanks!",82,1527803012.0,8niidg,210,CMV: You shouldn't be able to donate to a politician unless you live in their district,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/8niidg/cmv_you_shouldnt_be_able_to_donate_to_a/,2018-05-31 17:43:32
"This is just something I want to get off my chest because it's been bothering me for a while now.

Stain was wrong.

Okay, that's a bit inaccurate. He wasn't entirely wrong. Just mostly wrong.

Stain had the ideal that heroes, true heroes, were those that did their job (save people) unselfishly without need for payment of any kind, fame, or glory, and anyone who sought such a thing was not a true hero and deserved to be killed.

Almost every part of that ideal is wrong and unreasonable, yet people seem to have latched onto it not only in the series but real life as well. 

Are they wrong to have this opinion? Obviously, I think so. Are they allowed to? Sure, everyone's allowed an opinion, even if I think it's stupid.

The main problem with this ideal, I think, is the expectation that all heroes should be selfless. That they should all be All Might or Deku and run into danger no matter what to help others simply to help others. Now, that's an amazing trait to have. It is also insane and brave (read: stupid), having gotten both of them nearly killed multiple times, but that's a different rant entirely. 

Point is, most people aren't like that. Most people would want some kind of reward for risking their life, be it money or the praise of the general public. Is this selfish? Yeah, a bit, but it's also reasonable because heroes in this world are basically fancy cops. And cops get for being cops? Paid, cause the smiles of children and gratitude of the saved don't pay for your medical bills when you got third degree burns everywhere saving little Taro out of a burning building.

This whole Stain ideal has really made a comeback with our most recent villain, Gentle (and La Brava, but she's not important here.)

Gentle was man who wanted to be a hero. Why? So that his name would go down in history. Not a very selfless ideal to follow, and some have taken this to mean he was never really a hero at all, that he was never on a path to good. 

That's bullshit. 

So what if he wanted to be a hero for the fame and glory? As long he's out there helping people, what does it matter? It sure won't matter to the people he saves to garner said fame.

What about Bakugo, our resident explosive boy? He's a hero because he likes winning, because he wants to be the best like never one ever was (Bakumon!). Now he's learning that's not all there is to being a hero, but he wasn't wrong before. Even if all he did was beat the shit out of villains to prove his superiority, cause that boy has a complex, he'd still be a hero.

But ya know, those two are controversial amongst fans with mixed opinions about them, so let's do someone who is pretty well loved.

Uraraka Ochako. Uravity. Our lovely main heroine and a top tier best girl. Her desire to be a hero is not one based on a selfless desire to help her fellow man, but for that money. For her family of course, but that's still pretty selfish. Even she recognizes that. Does this make  Rara a bad person and a shitty person worthy of death at Stain's hands?

Rhetorical question. If you said yes, you're a monster.

The point of this rambling is that Stain is wrong. A hero's a hero as long as they do their job properly no matter their reason for being one. Now if they aren't doing their job for some greedy or corrupt reason, then sure, you TMNT reject, go for it. Otherwise, fuck off.

TL;DR: It's just the title, you can probably figure out what I mean, you're a smart person. And attractive. And have a very large genitalia of whatever gender you are. I'm not saying this just so you'll give me upvotes, the only things that fill my hollow, lonely life.

"I practically raised my little brothers. Our parents worked minimum wage jobs in the city, an hours drive away that had them leaving in the morning when it was still dark and the sea was calm beneath a grey dawn. We were left behind in the small coastal town we were born in, where there weren‚Äôt enough jobs to go around. My earliest memory is my dad teaching me to swim in the ocean, surrounded by all that blue, salt on my tongue, a taste you never quite shake growing up in a place like this. I think the only thing that saved my parents marriage was the fact that they hardly saw each other, sleeping back to back in the same bed the closest they ever got. They were married right out of high school, nineteen and too young to see the future of lifelong bills and debts they couldn't pay that waited for them. I‚Äôd seen their wedding photo, my dad in a rented suit that fit him wrong looking at my mom like she was the answer. My mom was the quiet type, and every year she seemed to get more distant, spending more and more of her time staring at the waves.

My brothers were twins, born within less than a minute of each other. Milo came into this world first, alone, and Danny followed, like he always did. From the moment he was born, Danny had never been without Milo. I was five years older than them, but I didn‚Äôt mind the months that stretched between us. I knew they both loved me, just couldn't love me the same way they loved each other. Milo was the dark to Danny‚Äôs light. Milo loved to run, chasing rabbits down on the dunes, racing gulls along the boardwalk. Danny liked to be still, watching the sky change colour, daydreaming stretched out on the sand. Danny covered his face in his hands at the violent parts of movies and Milo‚Äôs eyes would never leave the screen. But eventually he‚Äôd sigh and fast forward past, every time. Anything for Danny.

But Danny would follow Milo anywhere. When they were thirteen, Milo came home with a buzz\-cut. Mom cried because his baby\-blonde hair, soft like sunlight, was gone, and Milo looked like a stranger sitting up on the kitchen counter. Dad had yelled, but as always was too tired to follow through on his threats. You could see the curve of his skull showing behind a stubble of gold, like a cornfield burned down. Danny stared at him, ocean eyes brimming with brine, for the first time in their lives not a mirror image. He had taken Milo by the hand, dragging him upstairs. A few minutes later we heard the hum of dads electric razor from the bathroom, and when they reappeared Danny‚Äôs hair was gone too, washed down the shower drain like the childhood they were leaving behind.

When the boys were six and had started losing their baby teeth, I told them stories about the tooth fairy. Danny had listened anxiously, hanging onto every word. Milo had grinned at me from behind his back, even at six not believing a word, but not ruining the magic for Danny. Danny lost a tooth first, spat delicately into the bathroom sink, blood splattering the porcelain like a constellation in red. He had carefully placed it under his pillow, going to bed early that night so the tooth fairy would come sooner. Milo came into my room just before their bedtime. The moon hung outside my open window, stealing the tides from the shore. Milo grinned and pulled the tooth that had been loose all week right out of his mouth, handing it to me triumphantly, blood pooling in his palm.

When I was fifteen, a summer storm knocked the power out, every light in the house blowing at once. Me and Milo had been on the beach, swimming in the warm rain with our mouths wide open, summer dripping down our throats. We watched from the water as the lights in the houses that backed onto the sand suddenly died. Milo ran all the way home, feet bare on the tarmac, bringing the ocean with him on his skin. I followed but I couldn't keep up. When Milo ran it was like trying to chase the tide, always just out of reach. Danny was in his bedroom, terrified of the dark that filled the hallways. Danny cried from upstairs and Milo banged open every drawer in the kitchen, grabbing candles, bringing them to life carefully with a plastic green lighter. I didn't ask where he hadgot it from, watching from the doorway as he placed the candles carefully all over Danny‚Äôs room, comforting him, saying the dark was only because of the storm, he didn't need to be scared when he was with Milo.

I knew I had to go to the basement to flip the fuse box back on. I was terrified of our basement. Once when I was younger the sea had flooded in, leaving strange tide marks on the walls, a steady drip always echoing from the ceiling. I had bad dreams about the basement, of a voice calling me down into the dark. I stood outside the door, knuckles white on the handle, trying to be brave for Danny. Before I could open it, Milo had slipped his hand into my free one, squeezing tight. Together we walked into the basement armed with flashlights, and turned the power back on. When I was with Milo, I wasn't scared either; my little brother was far darker than anything waiting for me down the steps.

When they were seven, I found Milo out on the dunes by the cliffs. Danny was reading on the beach on his back. Milo was crouched over, tears dripping into the sea grass and lavender that grew every spring, just out of reach from being drowned. At his feet was a rabbit, velvet soft, its neck broken. I crouched next to him, and he clung to me, sobbing into my shoulder, small and afraid as seagulls wheeled white into the sky.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to do it, Daisy,‚Äù and then quieter, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone.‚Äù His voice was muffled in my sweatshirt as it soaked up the salt. I stroked his hair, and we buried the rabbit together, driftwood a grave marker. We never told Danny.

When the boys were eleven and I‚Äôd just got my licence, I decided to take them for a drive in my car, third\-hand off a neighbour. I loved that car, rusted and yellow with a cracked headlight that made it look like it was winking. They raced to sit shotgun and I watched as Milo let Danny win, pretending to trip at the last second. We drove with the windows down, ocean breeze lifting my hair like a veil over my face, road stretching wide with possibility beneath the wheels. Danny loved to swim, loved floating belly up in the waves watching the clouds. Milo was terrified of the open water once you got past the cliffs; but always swam past them, always pushing, always going too far, despite the fear that made him shake as he stepped into the tide. And Danny always followed. Sometimes when I watched them swimming from the shore, I couldn‚Äôt tell who was who out in the water.

When I was fourteen, Danny started getting night terrors. Our parents would sleep through them, too deep at the bottom of their dreams from their 60 hour week to wake up. I would get up every time, eyes half shut, but Milo always beat me to it. I‚Äôd reach Danny‚Äôs room and find him already back asleep, Milo curled up on the twin size mattress with him like a guard dog, a tangle of limbs. I‚Äôd watch them a while, to make sure they were okay, breathing in time like they shared a set of lungs. Growing up we didn't have a garden, because the beach was our back yard. We had a deck, painted white by dad when they first bought the house, a menagerie of mismatched sun loungers and chairs pulled from skips. When I was fourteen, I found the bird bones buried underneath. Too many bones to come from any less than ten. Milo cried when I confronted him and I held him through it.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone Daisy,‚Äù he said, eyes like the ocean.

We were both scared by then.

When the boys were thirteen, Danny stopped eating. Our parents were oblivious, even as bags like bruises under his eyes appeared and his wrists became tiny beneath the long sleeves he always wore. They left before breakfast in the morning and got home after I‚Äôd made dinner, heating up whatever I‚Äôd made in the microwave. Me and Milo watched him waste away until his ribs were starting to show. Milo stopped swimming so far out, terrified Danny would drown if he got too tired. I asked him why, trying to hold back tears after I made him vanilla birthday cake even though they wouldn't turn fourteen for another three months. He managed two bites. He wouldn't talk to me no matter how hard I tried to reach him. Milo told me it was because Danny was too sad, the world made him too sad.

I worked overtime every weekend at the beach restaurant in town, pulling night shifts as often as I could, leaving the fridge stacked with ready meals for the boys. My grades slipped as I slept through most of my classes, but I didn‚Äôt care. My parents had finally noticed Danny was sick. They hadn‚Äôt noticed Milo was too. Six months of saving and we finally had enough money to send Danny to a therapist. Milo went with him to every single appointment, sitting in the waiting room flipping through the magazines, hands thrumming with nervous energy. I‚Äôd give him the old receipts and crumpled calculus notes from the bottom of my bag while we waited and he‚Äôd turn them into paper birds. He would hand them over to his brother wordlessly on the drive home, and Danny kept them on his windowsill like reminders. Danny started painting as part of his therapy, otherworldly canvases thick with colours. He would draw for hours, on newspaper and take\-away menus and napkins. Milo kept every single drawing he gave him, taping them pride of place onto his bedroom wall.

Dad lost his job and I dropped out from my final year of high school to help at home to look after the boys, but they both knew it was really because of Danny, still shades too small. Danny cried when I told them, begging me to go back, terrified he was ruining my life. Milo rolled his eyes and brushed the tears roughly from his face with the backs of his knuckles, saying if I‚Äôd wanted to I would have stayed. I loved them both so much in that moment, wrapping my arms around them and locking us together in a knot of sun\-tan arms and dirty blonde hair. We sat on the deck, Danny drawing and Milo fighting with his homework, string of fairy lights blowing in the sea breeze. It was only supposed to be until Dad found another job.

When they were fifteen, I was still living at home, working as a cleaner at the beach\-front hotel part time while I went to night school to get my GED. I‚Äôd started seeing Tom. He could surf, badly, and was a bartender at one of the two bars in town. He loved me a little more than I loved him, but it suited us both fine. The first time he came over, Danny hadn‚Äôt spoken a word, just staring suspicious from his seat on the couch, feet curled under him like a cat. Milo had sized him up, getting into his personal space despite being a head shorter. Tom had just laughed at them both and it was how I‚Äôd known I wanted him to stick around. Their hair had grown back, dirt blonde but not as soft as when they‚Äôd been little. They had taken to cliff jumping that summer. Milo would fling himself off without hesitation, screaming with pure visceral joy as he fell through the sky. And Danny would always follow, despite his fear of the rocks below. I couldn't bear to watch them, heart in my mouth every time as my brothers were swallowed by the sea. But every time they surfaced together, laughing and yelling at the waves.

When they were fifteen, Milo started staying out every night until past midnight, climbing in the window that Danny would leave open for him. I said nothing, but noticed when missing dog posters started multiplying in the neighbourhood. Notches grew on Milos wrist, precise in scar tissue. Again I said nothing. Danny started skipping school to go to the beach, would come home smelling like the sea, pockets full of shells and green sea glass. Danny loved sea glass, broken bottles worn down by the waves until they washed up something new. Milo started fighting at school, would come home with new shades of purple on his knuckles, bruises like the sky after lightning hit the sea leaving dead fish adrift on the surface. Once he came home with a gash above his eyebrow that dripped into his eyes until all he saw was red. The other boy was off school a week, and Milo was suspended for two. Mom and dad grounded him and I sat him on the side of the tub as I cleaned it as best I could, hands clumsy with worry.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hurt them Daisy,‚Äù he told me as I pressed a bandaid gently on the broken skin, and I knew he meant it.

On my 21st birthday, mom and dad both called in sick. For the first time I could remember we were all in one place, no longer adrift in the world. My parents gave me money, suddenly shy, apologising it wasn't enough. I knew how many hours had gone into the small envelope in my hands and I told them so. Danny gave me a painting he‚Äôd done of me walking out into the ocean. It was beautiful, delicate swirls of blues and greens and purples, my hair merging with the waves as it blew in a non\-existent breeze. Milo gave me a necklace, just as beautiful. It was a delicate silver chain with a pendant shaped like a daisy. I wore it every day after that, never taking it off. I smacked a kiss on Milo‚Äôs forehead and he retched, wiping it off, but I could tell from the grin that filled his face he was secretly pleased. I remembered when the boys had started high school, driving them in on their first day. The football coach had seen Milo running track, other boys left long behind, because you cant‚Äôt catch the tide. Milo had immediately been put on the on the team. Milo could run until his legs gave up, until he burned out. Danny had tried out for the team too, but didn‚Äôt make it. A week later Milo had quit. Couldn't see the point if his brother wasn't there with him.

When the twins reached seventeen, Milo started drinking with his friends, boys with fast cars and low lives. It seemed like there was someone new in his bed every week, boys and girls always gone by the morning. Danny brought nobody home, but I saw the way he would blush every time we bought slushies from the 7/11 from the pretty girl behind the counter with the crooked front teeth.

One morning I watched the boys racing down the sand, muscles in Milos back rippling like wings beneath the surface of his skin, slowing himself just enough that Danny could keep up. A group of Milo‚Äôs friends waited in the surf, shoving each other into the waves, playing chicken balancing on shoulders, all salty smiles and sunburnt skin. I watched as Milo and one of the boys played at drowning each other. Milo held him under just a little to long, a little too hard. The boy surfaced, coughing the ocean out of his lungs. The others laughter it off, but I could tell it was the uneasy kind, as if realising for the first time there was a wild animal living in the skin of their friend. Milo went to parties every Friday. Danny was never invited. But Milo took him along every time, arm round his shoulders like a warning to outsiders, and nobody would ever question Milo.

When they were seventeen I saw Milo staring at a dead fox in the drive way, hit by a car off the main road. He stared at it, lifeless and beautiful, until Danny saw and started to cry softly, heartbroken. Milo buried it in the flower bed for him so Danny wouldn't have to. I knew Milo wasn‚Äôt bad and I told him often enough. But there was something dark in him that was, something that had never seen the light, and it was howling to get out.

On the boys‚Äô eighteenth birthday, I made vanilla cake and Danny ate every bite, blowing out the candles with Milo, both of them wishing with their eyes closed and shoulders overlapping. On the evening of their eighteenth birthday they went to the bar where Tom worked that turned a blind eye to local kids with fake IDs. I got a call from Danny at 1am, sobbing down the phone. He was calling from the hospital. Milo had been stabbed in a bar fight with a man twice his size. Tom had driven them, carrying Milo to the car where he lay with his head in Danny‚Äôs lap, bleeding into the upholstery. I didn‚Äôt wake mom and dad, another secret I would keep for Milo. I drove over the speed limit the whole way. Danny was sat by the side of the hospital bed, still crying as Milo begged him to stop.

‚ÄúHey sis,‚Äù he said, grinning wide as the sea. I slapped him hard, threatening everything under the sun if he ever tried something like that again. He laughed and promised he wouldn‚Äôt. I knew he didn‚Äôt want to. I knew he would.

It was a Friday afternoon in the summer after the boys graduated. Mom and Dad had watched from the back of the hall. I‚Äôd been sitting in the front row with Tom, both of us yelling and waving, embarrassing them on purpose. I was so proud, framed both of their diplomas and hung them in the hallway, the first thing anyone would see when they came into the house. Danny thought about everything carefully, head always in the clouds. Milo was all blood and bones, a force of nature, like a shark that could never stop swimming or he‚Äôd drown. That night Milo was out cruising in the car they shared, no doubt full of his friends smoking and drinking even though the sun hadn‚Äôt set. Danny came into the kitchen where I was starting on dinner. Tom was watching TV, a gory news report about a recent serial spree of murders on the other side of the country dubbed ‚ÄúThe Angel Killings‚Äù. He hastily switched it off as Danny appeared in his best jeans, and Milo‚Äôs leather jacket. I raised an eyebrow. The jacket was Milo‚Äôs pride and joy, showed how much he loved his brother that he‚Äôd let him borrow it.

The girl working at the 7/11 had written her number on the slushy cup she‚Äôd given him. Her name was Rosie. He showed me, shy and proud, staring like it was made of straight gold. They were going to the bonfire on the dunes that night. He begged to borrow my car as Milo had theirs. If it had been Milo asking I would have said a hard no, knowing he‚Äôd probably drive it into the ocean drunk. Or off a cliff. But Danny wasn‚Äôt a drinker, preferred the beer the kids would store in coolers in the sea to keep them cold, over the hard stuff Milo kept in the bottom of his wardrobe. I made him promise he wouldn't drive drunk. I made him promise to be careful. I made him promise to be home by 2. I handed him the keys, watching him drive away to pick up his girl.

I woke up at 5am. The house was a still and silent thing, gentle hush of the sea outside. I left Tom sleeping in bed, pulling the blankets over his head. Both boys rooms were empty. I checked my phone. 11 missed calls from Danny. I slipped on boots, leaving the laces untied, too pissed off to care. I jogged down the hill to where the sand met the tarmac, sky lavender above the dunes. I walked the length of the beach, calling their names, furious. I expected to find Milo passed out drunk and Danny crying with worry. In the half\-light casting gently on the scattered driftwood, by the base of the cliffs I saw a mess of figures, dark blue with shadow. As I got closer I saw my brothers, kneeling in the shallow water as the tide crept closer, salt blowing off the sea through the dirt blonde of their hair.

‚ÄúDan, c‚Äômon, you have to call them,‚Äù Milo said gently, pressing his phone into Danny‚Äôs hand. Danny pushed it away, shaking his head, tears falling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call them then,‚Äù Milo sighed, raising the phone to his ear. He gripped Danny‚Äôs chin in his free hand, lightly turning it this way and that, looking at the cut on his mouth, blood smeared on his chin, bruise on his cheek. ‚ÄúHello officer? Yeah, uh, I‚Äôd like to report a murder.‚Äù

Five bodies lay between them, blood swallowed softly by the sea. Each of them had multiple stab wounds to the chest, to the neck, to the hands, blooming like dark flowers through the torn material of their shirts, hair wet in the swirl of water. Danny and Milo sat opposite each other, wrists locked together, and I couldn't tell who was who as the tide came in.

The bodies belonged to three boys that had graduated the same year as the twins, and two older men I didn't recognise. They wanted Milo, wanted blood. Wanted him dead. Milo had been in too deep with some bad people. They had seen Danny in his brother‚Äôs jacket and thought he was his Milo, dragging him to the edge of the beach away from the bonfire, knives in their pockets, guns slipped down the back of jeans and tucked beneath shirts. But Milo had stopped them. Anything for Danny.

Milo leaned back, head on Danny‚Äôs lap, no longer able to sit upright as the salt from his blood mixed with the salt of the ocean, surf breaking on his knees like unknown islands. Danny pressed a hand to the hole torn in his brothers chest, as if to check their heartbeats were still keeping perfect time, blood spilling over between the gaps in his fingers. Milos eyes fluttered, like the wings of a bird, red meeting blue in the water around them. He placed a hand over Danny‚Äôs as his breathing slowed. I knew my little brother wasn‚Äôt bad, but the thing that lived inside of him was.

I fell to my knees, silent as dawn washed the sky clean and sirens sounded in the distance.

‚ÄúHey Daisy,‚Äù Milo smiled, wide as the sea and sky. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. Now I can‚Äôt hurt anyone.‚Äù",19,1527819324.0,8nkp6i,152,He didn't want to hurt anyone,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8nkp6i/he_didnt_want_to_hurt_anyone/,2018-05-31 22:15:24

"I'm genuinely surprised at how forgettable for most people Ian Dietrich was. He was probably my favorite character in the Battle of Trost arc. He had the characteristics of an incredibly competent commander all over him : Extremely skilled, highly intelligent, thinks outside the box, is ready to sacrifice himself and others for the greater good. I like how he put his faith in Eren and Mikasa despite being rookies, especially how he instantly recognised Mikasa's skills and valued them, and was even interested in knowing how ""she became like that"". There was a small mentor/mentee bond between him and Mikasa, judging from Mikasa's reaction seeing him get eaten. Also, when Armin was talking with Jean about people who are able to throw their humanity aside, he remembred Ian, meaning that he recognises his leadership abilities. 

I really liked  Ian's character and I feel like I'm the only one who remembers him. Are there any people who share the same opinion on his character ?

"Back in Enies Lobby arc, there was this one moment between Sanji and Usopp, right after Sanji saves him from Jyabura. Usopp feels useless for not being able to do anything and Sanji says ""Everyone has things they can and cannot do. I'll do what you can't do, and you do what I can't do"". Back then I thought it was just Sanji being supportive and a good friend. But now, after the WCI arc and the whole thing with Sanji and his family, thinking back to that Enies Lobby moment, I feel his words have more weight now. It wasn't just him being a good friend. Sanji knows exactly how it feels to feel useless and be thought of as a failure.

"Delivery driver here, I have a doozy of a tale to share with you all. 


So I have a big box discount wholesale warehouse on my route that receives mixed lots of household goods in [gaylords](https://i.imgur.com/xV6VhC7.jpg) I bring in 6-8 of them every few days. The business resells them on various auction sites or to the general public. 


As they are a regular customer and very short staffed I do my own unloading to speed everything up on the receiving side. Normally I have my own equipment, but on this day I borrowed their walkie lift enblazened with their logo. 


Enter Mr/Mrs Clueless to the employee's only loading area: Mrs seems to wear the pants in the relationship imho. 

""Excuse me""

""Excuse me!""

""EXCUSE ME! I'M HERE TO PICK UP MY ORDER""

I made the mistake of making eye contact, seeing they weren't my concern and going back to finishing moving the thousands of dollars of product I was midway through. In their defense, Yes I look the part, I have a clipboard, safety vest, boots and I'm using their branded equipment. 


""Is this asshole ignoring us? what type asshole does that?"" She waddles back to her Dodge Ram and proceeds to blare her horn. I holler at her ""man"" that I'm a delivery person and to calm *** ***** down. 


It has been about 5 minutes from first contact, I'm starting to see red, but I resist the urge to unload a tirade on this raging khunt knowing the whole area is under video surveillance. Finally my reprieve is near as my POC appears, I flag him over and we huddle up; he sheepishly heads over to deal with her. 


I'm 30ft away

""FINALLY!!!, GUESS YOUR EMPLOYEE DOESN'T VALUE CUSTOMERS!! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOREVER""

but maam he's not our.....

""I JUST WANT MY ORDER ALSO GET ME YOUR FUCKEN MANAGER I WANT TO HAVE A WORD ABOUT HIS LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE, I KNOW CUSTOMER SERVICE, THIS IS A DISGRACE!'


holy fuck, I lost it. From 30ft away: 


LISTEN LADY, I DON'T WORK HERE I'M JUST HERE DELIVERING A LOAD! I UNDERSTAND CUSTOMER SERVICE JUST FINE, AND YOUR SETTING AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE WITH  CREATING A SCENE OVER YOUR OWN MISUNDERSTANDING. 

My POC was slack jawed, she was red as Clifford the dog. The scene has attracted attention, POC paged the manager to the dock. Feeling better I went back to get another load out of my truck. About 20 minutes pass when Manager Dick, yep that's his name,  Dick asks me about the status on a customs frozen shipment as we are closing out the order I delivered""

""It's part of her order""

I look it up and sure enough, 2 weeks frozen in the queue waiting on customs clearance.  *[waiting on cbsa paid tariffs, invoice emailed 3 weeks prior]*

""Have fun buddy! Tell her to check with her broker but the shipment is waiting on customs clearance""

I hightail it out of there, call me boss and give him the lowdown on the soon to be nuclear incoming phone call. 

""That's OK, we are charging them storage rates on it until it ships""

"I hope this qualifies as MC. A few years ago, I was assigned to go on a work trip with two other coworkers to one of our sites that's about 4 hours away. We were doing our Windows 7 upgrade, that site kept getting delayed because they moved and so our trip kept getting delayed because of the schedule of the other upgrades.

It was me, my coworker (CW), and a networking guy (NG) going on the 3-day trip. NG had moved on from our team but used to handle all of our remote sites and knew them like the back of his hand. He was passing the knowledge onto us and the rest of our team on how to handle these situations.

CW heard from NG through the grapevine that the trip had been delayed from the summer date we had planned until it was postponed for fall break (and then eventually winter break). However, we didn't hear word from our manager on it and as far as we knew, it was still happening over the summer. She was terrible at communicating and we frequently had to follow up with her multiple times on issues that we couldn't take care of. We got tired of asking her about every little thing and decided to play dumb.

The day before the scheduled date of the trip, our manager sends an email at 3:30 telling us the trip has been postponed. I'm still in the office so now I'm officially aware. CW leaves at 3 and is an hourly employee, therefore he wouldn't be checking his email after hours. He had already devised his plan for tomorrow.

The next day he comes into the office in sweatpants and a tee, holding his travel bag with some clothes in it to look believable. He comes in at his normal time, has to wait 2 hours for our manager comes in, and sees her official email about that day. When she comes in, he puts on the act:

>CW: So when were you going to tell us about the trip?

>M: I thought you'd see the email and kind of already knew since we haven't discussed more details of the trip.

"I'm a single dad \- and once it started to get hard to get up and down with a 4 and 5 year old hanging on me, I decided something had to change.  My youngest asked me if I had a baby in my belly, on more than one occasion.  

I've been depressed for longer than I care to admit \- I finally got out of an abusive relationship back in November, and immediately filed for divorce \- meanwhile my soon\-to\-be\-ex wife has been indicted on two felonies for gun violence towards me and my children.  It's been a really rough adaptation for us all, but one that was absolutely necessary for us.  I'm starting to realize that I'm not the worthless, unattractive moron that I was always hearing \- and I'm starting to genuinely find happiness.

Physically \- I've dropped 2 inches in my waist, and 16 pounds, in the first 30 days.  I have energy, sometimes more than my kids do \- and today, I haven't unbuttoned the top button of my shirt \(I wear ties almost every day\) \- for the first time in probably 5 years.  

It's been a journey, but the past 30 days have really opened my eyes to how much I was drowning emotions in food.  Anyway, thanks for this community \- KCKO!",17,1527819448.0,8nkptc,134,30 days of Keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8nkptc/30_days_of_keto/,2018-05-31 22:17:28

"Il y a des fois, il faut se rendre √† l'√©vidence, √ßa fait du bien de pousser un cocorico.  
Au moment de son kickstarter, j'ai entendu parler du projet de s√©rie anim√©e LastMan, pr√©quelle √† la s√©rie de BD du m√™me nom. Je l'ai laiss√©e hors de mon radar. Depuis, elle a √©t√© diffus√©e en 2016 sur France 4 et est sortie en DVD, et l√† j'ai fini par c√©der √† la curiosit√©.   
Et je ne l'ai pas du tout regrett√©!  
  
Pour donner une id√©e de l'effet que √ßa m'a fait, c'est comme regarder un bon anime japonais d'action, mais auquel on aurait retir√© toutes les longueurs inutiles pour ne garder que le meilleur (les meilleurs blagues, les moments badass, les combats tant√¥t bourrins et tactiques, l'horreur, et tout de m√™me de bonnes doses d'√©motions, mais sans le moindre moment de remplissage). Il y a 26 √©pisodes de 12 minutes environ, soit environ 5h12 √† suivre le personnage principal, Richard Aldana.  
  
Le protagoniste, c'est important, surtout quand on a pas des centaines d'heures pour d√©velopper un r√©cit chorale. Ici on a une belle r√©ussite: un genre de best of de la t√©nacit√© et du grand c≈ìur d'un Rocky, la d√©brouillardise et les vannes d'un John McClane, et l'irr√©v√©rence et la Libido d'un Rio Saeba (Nicky Larson). Ce qui est impressionnant c'est que comme le reste de ce bouillon de pop culture, il garde sa propre identit√©: jeune gars dou√© mais sans le s√©rieux n√©cessaire pour briller sur le ring, qui doit se sortir les doigts quand les √©v√©nements l'obligent √† arr√™ter de tout prendre √† la rigolade.  
En effet il se retrouve √† devoir prot√©ger son petit monde quand son ami et obligatoire figure paternelle meurt, laissant derri√®re lui un club de boxe convoit√© par la p√®gre, et surtout une fille cach√©e convoit√©e elle par une soci√©t√© secr√®te d√©tentrice de secrets surnaturels.  
La petite Siri est attachante, d√©brouillarde et suit une trajectoire tr√®s int√©ressante.  
S'ajoutent √† √ßa d'autres personnages secondaires plus ou moins hauts en couleur, mais moins d√©velopp√©s.  
  
Et c'est en compagnie de ces personnages qu'on nous ballade dans un m√©lange des genres qui commence tr√®s l√©ger et juv√©nile, mais se dirige √† petits pas vers un final tr√®s √©mouvant. Entre-temps on aura crois√© un maffieux ob√®se en surv√™tement et bijoux bling-bling, des d√©mons mill√©naires assez d√©gueus, et un tournoi de boxe franchement bien rythm√©, entre autres.  
Vers le milieu on a pas mal d'√©pisodes sans grand impact sur l'ensemble de la trame, mais ils respectent votre temps et offrent tous de jolis moments. Beaucoup noteront la satire des infos fa√ßon BFM-TV assez grin√ßante √† l'√©pisode 20.
Certaine sous intrigues sont boucl√©es un peu vite, mais dans l'ensemble on a vraiment du tout bon, avec des dialogues tr√®s r√©ussis.
  
Comme on parle de dessin anim√©, il serait peut √™tre parler du visuel. On retrouve le style de J√©r√©mie Perrin, r√©alisateur du clip fantasy de Dye: traits anguleux et dynamiques, avec une √©paisseur organique, et des aplats nets. C'est classe, c'est propre. Il y a l√† un √©quilibre tr√®s bon entre un dessin qui bouge bien dans les sc√®nes d'action, et qui se regarde bien fig√© √©galement.  
Car il faut le dire, la s√©rie a un excellent sens de l'√©conomie, gardant ses effets pour l√† ou sa compte (principalement les sc√®nes d'action, qui foutent une p√™che monstre) et optant pour des mouvements de cam√©ras ou autres effets similaire pour donner du cachet et de fluidit√© a des sc√®nes quasiment fixes. C'est assez bien fait pour qu'on oublie vite l'artifice, et le petit budget qui l'a exig√©, et on rentre dans l'histoire. (Un des sc√©naristes, Balak, est derri√®re la s√©rie les Kassos et a beaucoup travaill√© sur la BD num√©rique. Hasard?)
  
C√¥t√© son on a droit √† un bon doublage et une bande originale d'inspiration  Synthwave (mais pas que) tr√®s r√©ussie.
Franchement si vous avez l'occasion de voire cette s√©rie, sautez sur l'occasion, c'est un divertissement de grande qualit√©, et probablement la s√©rie qui respecte le plus votre temps au monde.

"**Context:**

Westworld is a pretty popular show that deals with artificial intelligence and the development of self-awareness in robots (or 'hosts', as they're called here); the show is mainly set in an amusement park of sorts where humans can do whatever they want with... or against the hosts.

The bulk of the drama mainly revolves around one character, namely Dolores Abernathy, a host who becomes self-aware and decides to lead a rebellion against humanity. So far, in season 2, there's been quite a fair bit of criticism about her narrative, her overly clich√© dialogue, and her dramatic shift in personality -- all of which make her an unappealing character to some. 

The actress who plays her, Evan Rachel Wood, recently tweeted [this](https://twitter.com/evanrachelwood/status/1001655878368485376). r/Westworld however, is conflicted about it, [with some in support](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/8nc9du/erw_liked_these_tweets_from_me_last_night_i/), others not so much, [with one calling it a 'meltdown'.](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/8ndm7f/thoughts_on_evan_rachel_woods_twitter_meltdown/) And that, ladies and gentlemen, gives us today's tasty, popcorn-flavored...

- [2. ""Point being culturally guys are allowed to be bad. We like it, accept it, encourage rough tough men. Women we like smiling, sweet, innocent, and vulnerable. When it clashes with our unconscious biases we then dislike the girl now that she's the opposite.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/8n5435/evan_rachel_wood_speaks_out_on_dolores_hate_this/dzsxofg/?context=2)

- [4. ""This happens on practically every show though. Female leads are always complained about, from Kate on Lost to Skyler on Breaking Bad, every main love interest in a superhero show. At what point does that pattern stop being about character and portrayal and start being about the gender they have in common?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/8n5435/evan_rachel_wood_speaks_out_on_dolores_hate_this/dztazjo/?context=2)

- [5. ""eh, when i come on here and i see virtually no criticism of any storyline involving bernard, ford, william, but a shit ton involving maeve and dolores...i don't know what to say man. i mean dolores is supposed to be a sort of one-note bad guy now, but i don't find her story less interesting. they honestly did the same thing with bernard - he's just spent the entire season being confused, and i still find his storyline compelling. the best way i can forgive this is that dolores' storyline no longer contains any real mysteries, which are the lifeblood of this show. but still, it's honestly been a little weird how the criticism has lined up, and i don't think evan rachel wood is totally wrong about this.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/8n5435/evan_rachel_wood_speaks_out_on_dolores_hate_this/dzt53ho/?context=4)

- [6. ""Don't bother. 90% of the mouth breathers on here don't even know what sexism means. But yeah, I agree with you. Notice that guy says ""Bernard has a ton of potential"" but for some reason, Dolores doesn't get that benefit of the doubt. Some people here are enormously ignorant. They don't think they're sexist because they literally don't understand it. It's kinda sad.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/8n5435/evan_rachel_wood_speaks_out_on_dolores_hate_this/dzt35p3/?context=1)

"I‚Äôve managed to lose just over 100 pounds since last March.  My stats ‚Äì I‚Äôm a 6 foot tall 32 year old dude.  I started at 412lbs now down to 310.  But before I get to the ‚Äúhow I done it‚Äù portion I feel a little backstory is needed.  If you just came here for progress pics feel free to scroll to the bottom for a TLDR and the super fat‚Ä¶..to not quite as fat pics you came for.  


In November of 2011 I stumbled across r/loseit.  At the time I was 402 pounds.  I‚Äôm not sure what snapped at the time, but I decided I was going to lose 100lbs in a year.  So from Dec 2011-Dec2012 I did just that.  Basically by counting calories and light cardio.  r/loseit was a big part of that. I remember being so encouraged by my day one post, and I occasionally will go back and look at it even now. 


2013-2014 I didn‚Äôt really lose much more. The lowest I got down to was 290.  There were several factors (read; excuses) to my weight loss not continuing.  My son was born in 2013, and we moved a couple times in that span.  But the real culprit was I had lost that drive.  I was so determined to lose 100lbs in a year that I wasn‚Äôt focused enough on what to do after that.  So I would lose and gain the same 10 lbs over and over.  


At the end of 2014 I started to struggle with depression.  A little more backstory to the backstory:  I grew up very conservative Christian.  I went to Bible college, got a Bachelors degree in Biblical studies, and became a full time minister right out of school.  Around the end of 2014 I began to have serious doubts about the faith.  Being a paid professional Christian and not even being sure you believe any of it is a real bitch.  I hid it from everyone (not a great idea).  I decided the ministry wasn‚Äôt for me anymore and began the process of going back to school under the guise of becoming a ‚Äúlay-minister‚Äù.  What I was hiding from everyone was that I was slowing leaving the faith and creating my escape plan.  Aaaaannnyway, to sum up all that apostacy I eventually lost every last bit of my belief in god and finally told my wife and the other church leaders until very recently. 


The stress from totally deconstructing my professional and private life was not good for my personal health.  2015-2016 I gained ALL the weight back.  Plus about 10 pounds.  I was struggling with who I was fundamentally as a person.  And trying to do it totally alone.  I would get so upset at myself for gaining the weight back.  I was so determined to not be that person, to not be one of those statistics.  But it happened.  I was ashamed and embarrassed nearly all the time.  I HATED seeing people who hadn‚Äôt seen me in a while.  I knew folks could tell, but I couldn‚Äôt pull myself out of the tailspin.  I even avoided r/loseit because it reminded me of my failure.  


But, in March of last year I decided feeling sorry for myself wasn‚Äôt going to get me anywhere.  I had come out the other side of my faith deconstruction (privately at least, the public part has really just begun), and I felt like I could focus on my health again.  I knew what to do, so I did it.  I counted calories and walked.  I had folks I knew would help keep me accountable.  And since that time I‚Äôve lost 102 pounds.  412 down to 310.  

I still struggle sometimes with the idea that I haven‚Äôt accomplished anything.  Because I‚Äôm losing weight I‚Äôve already lost.  But that 290 mark is looming, and I can‚Äôt wait to be losing weight ‚Äúfor the first time‚Äù.  It is a struggle, but I‚Äôve learned that it all comes down to one thing for me.  CONSISTENCY.  Just.  Keep.  Going.  I‚Äôve still got some real issues to sort out in my personal life, but this time I‚Äôm not letting that derail me.  Being in control of my health and fitness has given me something to ground myself in.  A sanctuary, a respite.  

If you‚Äôre reading this and you‚Äôve lost weight only to gain it back, YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN.  It is worth it.  You know what you need to do, and it isn‚Äôt a race against your former self.  If you could go back in time and not gain the weight I know you would.  But you can‚Äôt do that.  But what you can do is do your future self a real favor by starting back NOW.  Try not to feel sorry for yourself.  I know it is hard, but it is worth it.
Some encouraging things after that slog of a post ‚Äì I can fit back in all my old clothes!  Also people are really beginning to notice since I‚Äôm starting to wear clothes that fit.  Another comment I wasn‚Äôt expecting was I‚Äôve had several folks at work tell me I look taller.  I credit that to not trying to slouch and hide my moobies. Oh, the moobies are definitely still there, I just don‚Äôt let it bother me anymore.  

TL:DR
I was fat.  Got less fat.  Got depressed.  Got fat again.  Got less fat again.  Trying to get less less fat.  

So, how about some comparison pictures.  Full body shot first.  [This](https://i.imgur.com/uge78OJ.jpg) picture is from my uncle‚Äôs wedding circa Oct 2016.  [Here](https://i.imgur.com/PnQVuds.jpg) is one from this week.  Now for the ever-flattering selfie.  [Here](https://i.imgur.com/dkxPFTI.jpg) is one from early last year.  [Here](https://i.imgur.com/GISRQgG.jpg) is one from last week.  Now a pic with my little boy.  [One](https://i.imgur.com/vQiGVDq.png) from 2016 and [one](https://i.imgur.com/irWPRGm.jpg) from a month ago or so.  I call this the unsuspecting birthday shot.

My goal for this time next year to is to be down to 250.  Keep up the good work folks.  I‚Äôll leave you with my fitness mantra.  The pain of being fat is way worse than the pain of getting fit!

"Long time lurker, first time poster, many a year ago I saw this question on this sub and some of the stories re inspired my love for history. Now I am a little older and a little more versed, have students now and well, I claimed to have all these awesome history stories but this year felt like I was running out and blurring some of the details. So I did some reading up on my own favorite history story and have been waiting for someone to ask the question so I could share the love.

Please! I need more stories to entertain students! 
(I work in a theater, not a licensed teacher)

My favorite story if you didn‚Äôt guess from my name is about bacchanalia! Long story short, I pretty much am just referencing the wiki article and lectures from a single 200level on rome years ago... well Greek cities have a patron deity, and their big temples as I understand it have like little statues for all the gods in the entrance but deep inside have a huge temple just to their patron deity, and a special set of priests as well. These priests and their orders were called secret mystery cults, as I understand it, where the reward for serving the patron priests and deity was a set of secret knowledge. Famously the Pythagorean secret was impossible numbers, like anything divided by zero and other holes and exceptions in math.

Anyway Dionysus was a really cool and important god especially for theater and maintenance of Greek culture cause of the Dionysian festivals and, well, when the romans whole sale adopted Greek religion just changing names they also adopted aspects of the secret mystery cults. Dionysus became Bacchus, and his cult bacchanalia. He‚Äôs the god of wine and revelry and has the big festivals and well they were orgiastic and really popular, what do you know, especially in the Italian countryside.

In came the old Roman elites whose daughters were losing their virginities at these parties, especially the ones reserved for being vestal virgins, which is kinda like an Oracle but with less creepy old people using drugs on you and more or a status thing for the girls families. (Conjecture to be funny!) So the old paterfamilias started trying to outlaw these orgies and there came lex bacchanalia I, the first law in human history persecuting someone for their religious beliefs and not for any measurable crime against society. It forbade women attending I think, I forget the order and progression but the third lex bacchanalia was the first law in human history punishing someone to death for their beliefs... and as such was precedent (romans love precedent) for every christian martyrdom, then later the reprisals against the pagans by the Christians. Also it declared the old bacchanalian temples sacrosanct, and by the time rome fell the invaders would find the abandoned temples already in ruins and just leave them. Many of the most famous surviving Roman art and especially like the floor tile frescos of crazy mushrooms and animal Orgies only survived because it was common knowledge the last thousand years those places were ‚Äúcursed‚Äù. 

And to think, that such a fun and good thing as Dionysus and his arts festivals and orgies would someday be the source of so much evil, the antithetical source anyway... I think it‚Äôs the coolest history story. 

That said Garbo could be made into a movie a lot better.

"There have been a few incidents recently revolving around victim blaming and the mod team would just like to clarify our definition of victim blaming for this sub.  This will be added to the wiki and sidebar as well, for future reference.

---------------------

**What it is:** saying someone is at fault/deserved something due to an everyday action.  For example, wearing a certain kind of clothing, dancing at a club, etc.

**What it isn't:** questioning/commenting on someone's actions if they actively escalate a situation -- i.e. someone goes to meet a known creep in person or otherwise agrees to see someone who has been an issue.  In general, actions that might not seem to fall within the bounds of common sense.

Name calling, of course, is still unacceptable.  However disagreeing with OPs actions is not always victim blaming.

Furthermore, in the future, please refrain from doing public call outs about victim blaming.  We understand the sentiment, however it only derails the thread and just devolves into slapfighting.  If you have an issue with a comment, please simply report, downvote, and move on.

"As it stands right now, Slurp juice is **not** worthy of being an epic/purple item.

They are viable in certain situations, but when have you ever held a slurp over 3 minis? A fat potion? For me, it's not even a question. Mini's and 50 pots are both lower in rarity than Slurp's and are chosen infinitely more often. Slurp's right now are only good if you bandaged up to 75 hp and need the little push to get back to full. In other words, *something* about the Slurp's need to change.

There are a lot of ways to make the Slurp more useful/live up to it's epic rarity, but I think the following buff's would be the most beneficial:

1. Allow us to stack **three** at a time, but still only spawn/drop one at a time.
2. Allow us to **consume more than one at a time** to stack the effects of health/shield instead of waiting the 25 seconds to pop another slurp.
3. Change the dynamic of slurp's. If you take one with 90 health & no shields, you'll get to full health and 40 shields. If you take it with 80 health and 20 shields, you'll finish with 100 health & 50 shields and so on . In other word's, have it operate similarly to how it currently does, **but if your health regens fully to 100, allow the difference to overflow onto shields**.
4. Decrease drop rate by \~10&#37; since we've buffed the effects.

"(this is a repost - this same request is being posted on /r/marvelstudios/,  /r/marvel/,  and /r/movies/,)

This is a serious question regarding fandom and a dying person (not me, I'm fine). It's not a subject I'm bringing here without reservations. If this is too depressing or squicks you out I totally understand that. You can skip this post; no hard feelings.

I know someone who's dying of ALS. If you don't know what that is, you can go here for details: https://www.als.ca/about-als/what-is-als/ It's bad. I mean confined-to-bed, ventilator, and feeding tube bad. I don't know her personally, but she's a good friend of a good friend, and that counts in my book.

Here's the thing: she's a huge Avengers movie fan. Avengers 4 is slated to come out in 2019 and probably she won't be here for it.

A buddy of mine tried to start a Twitter chain to alert various celebrities and groups in the hope that they will let her in on how the movie ends/general plotline/possible clips. You can read the post here: https://twitter.com/RobinWolfraim/status/1000899727121100803 and search #spoilersforchantelle if you want more. Please contact the original twitter poster for additional information on Chantelle, what this is about, and how you could help. Even a retweet would be appreciated.

The lady in question is not able to travel anywhere. None of us have cash to throw at this nor do I want to raise random funds with no clear direction on what to use them for. She's an adult so there's no ""make-a-wish"" option here. I have no idea if Marvel or Disney would be willing to risk spoiler leaks or if this is even feasible, but we're gonna try.

We're in the process of sending emails and letters to both Disney and Marvel. If you wish to send a request on her behalf yourself, you can find the links on their contact page here: https://www.thewaltdisneycompany.com/contact-us/
Please contact the original twitter poster, Robin, for details if you wish to do so before you send.

This feels like a thing the internet can group-source, but I have no idea how this could be accomplished. The clock is ticking and if this is gonna happen in any form, it's gotta happen soon.

Thanks for sifting through this. Any and all help or suggestions are appreciated.",13,1527801832.0,8nidh7,280,seeking a Marvel-miracle for a dying fan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/8nidh7/seeking_a_marvelmiracle_for_a_dying_fan/,2018-05-31 17:23:52

"""LOTR movies were not made late, nor were they made early, they were made precisely when they were supposed to""

I was thinking about this the other day while rewatching the trilogy, I was amazing of how good these movies look right now, save for a few exceptions the entire trilogy holds perfectly to this time.

I know there are movies in the early 90's that look so good today, like Jurassic Park. But generally speaking, 90's special effects don't hold very well today. On the other hand, I feel that if LOTR movies were made today or in the early 2010's, the director would have been tempted to use much more CGI that would eventually look a bit dated. I mean, The Hobbit movies look fine, but you can tell the orcs are CGI, they don't look as good as they did in LOTR trilogy. We were really lucky that LOTR movies were made within that small range of years between 2001 and 2003 (I know preproduction started way earlier though).

"Hey guys,
26 year old father here. I work hard to support my family and I currently work in retail management, so I am actively looking for better employment opportunities.
I had a customer a couple of weeks ago who complimented my communication skills and handed me his business card. ‚ÄúWe sell financial services on commission and we make a lot of money doing it. I think you‚Äôd be a natural‚Äù he said. I thanked him for the compliment and handed him my business card in exchange. I didn‚Äôt think much more about the interaction until he texted me the next day. He wanted to meet me at the Panera Bread next to my work for lunch to discuss ‚Äúan exciting employment opportunity.‚Äù I agreed and we scheduled a time to meet the following day.

We met for lunch and he started making small talk with me and asking me questions about my children. We exchanged pleasantries and then he started explaining different types of life insurance policies. The concepts were easy enough to grasp. After describing a few other financial services, he asked me if selling these types of services would be something I‚Äôd be interested in. ‚ÄúAbsolutely,‚Äù I responded.
He then began to describe the company he worked for, Primerica, and how commission is essentially split between sales reps and their superiors. The more questions I asked, the more odd the structure of the business seemed. 
I asked if leads were provided to sales reps or if this is a cold calling gig. He said that sales reps first utilize ‚Äúwarm markets,‚Äù which he explained is basically selling to family and close friends. ‚ÄúHow is that sustainable at all?‚Äù I asked. He insisted that word of mouth would spread and I would have more business than I could keep up with. I was skeptical to say the least. 

Then he dropped the bombshell. Sales reps have to pay a monthly fee ($80) and a one time registration fee ($200). Suddenly it all made sense. He wasn‚Äôt offering me a job, he was trying to sell a desperate father an ‚Äúopportunity.‚Äù He preys on people in tight financial situations and exploits them.

A couple of weeks later, I had a female customer compliment my ‚Äúpeople skills‚Äù and tell me she had a marketing position open at her company. ‚ÄúWhat kind of marketing,‚Äù I asked. She said it takes awhile to explain but that she would love to meet me at Panera Bread sometime to discuss it. I laughed and told her to get lost.

Anyway that‚Äôs my experience with these assholes. I found this sub and figured I‚Äôd share. I love all the MLM hate! Keep it coming.

"Diplomacy had failed, no compromise could be reached. As a last ditch effort to salvage the de-escalation talk and pave the way for peace, a human had been called in. They had all gathered to hear his plan in the large auditorium, a neutral space station for both sides.


&nbsp;


The strange human looked tiny standing in the middle. He begun to speak, ""It is clear to me that no simple peaceful solution can be found and escalation is currently fast progressing towards war. Therefore I have created some simpler doomsday weapons for both sides. These should be plenty to totally eradicate each other. Creating a balance without any additional forces required. Any questions?"" Dead silence, most weren't sure what they had heard. Some were and their play dead instincts had kicked in, littering the floor.


&nbsp;


One brave voice decided to speak up, ""Ehm, yes. What precisely do you mean by doomsday weapons?""

""Glad you asked! The forefather for these were developed when we were still a one planet civilization, in a world war on my planet and were used-""

A voice interrupted his speech, ""Wait, world war? And did you just say you used doomsday weapons on yourself?""

""Yes, the earliest iterations of theses weapons on a tiny scale. Proper ones capable of a more complete doomsday scenario was developed some years later.""

Another brave voice sounded from the audience, ""You keep saying doomsday, what do you mean?""

""The complete destruction of all larger life on a planet. Since you both are single planet species that should be plenty.""

Most had difficulty believing what he was saying. Others had regained control of their bodies again, only to hear the continuation of the conversation and promptly collapsed. ""So your plan is to give both sides the ability to completely eradicate the other... are you mad?""

""Yes, precisely! MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction. Firing of these weapons from one side will leave plenty of time for the other to retaliate. Leaving both sides worse off.""

""Dead!""

""Yes.""


&nbsp;


One of the highest ranked commanders in the room stood up, ""All in favor of barring entry to all humans from both our systems?""

""Aye,"" came the unanimous reply from the hall.

""Wait, it will work! We have done the same thing. Its not perfectly safe but-"" He began to say many other things, but the guards had gotten to the podium and started to drag him towards the exit.


&nbsp;


Later a compromise of a defensive alliance to counter the human threat was created. Barring entry from any and all humans. With the threat of their total destruction should they not comply.

"I'm a woman in the same age range as a lot of these contestants \(mid to late twenties\) and my fucking god.  The natural beauty \+ the artificial beauty of these women has really made me reevaluate where I fall on the attractiveness scale.  I've always struggled with body dysmorphia, but it's been mainly focused on my figure and influenced by my eating disorder.  Ever since immersing myself in these contestant profiles \(Amanda, how are you so symmetrical?!\), I've become hyper obsessed with my face.  I just have this growing list in my head of shit I need to get done to my face \(not that I can afford any of it!\) and although I've always been critical of my own appearance, the thought that I could/should be doing more to become more attractive is so much more pervasive.

And yes, I realize I should disengage from ""reality"" tv social media and I have.  I don't follow any celebrities or reality tv contestants but sometimes it pops up on my explore feed or I see ads tailored to cosmetic improvements \(my own fault for researching the cost of fillers and hair extensions and nose jobs\) and I feel like the world is getting prettier and I'm just staying the same.

"So, some background: I'm a childhood sexual abuse survivor, and I recently realized I'm attracted to children and younger teenagers. I've kind of known my whole life, but I suppressed it until recently. I'm disabled and living with my parents, although I'm a legal adult, I don't really have the independence needed. I'm technically not disabled enough to be considered mentally deficient in the eyes of the law, though. I have severe executive dysfunction issues that make it hard for me to make money, work, or manage finances (basically, any big-picture stuff), though, so that's also still handled by my parents.

Anyway, the question is, are just thoughts with no intent or history of acting on it (including not consuming child pornography; that's still harming children) still grounds for mandated reporting in Connecticut? I know the laws vary by state. And, a sub question, would I have legal recourse if they violated doctor/patient confidentiality?

"*""We fight like cats and dogs, but we really do love each other, right?""*

That was Layla's favorite line. We were... you know, *that* kind of couple. People would have called us Joanie and Chachi, or Ronny and Sammy, or any other corny generation-claiming example that fit two people who really did not belong together. 

People *probably* would have called us that. If people *knew* we were together. We kept it quiet, and it's stayed that way ever since.

We were just teenagers, after all, who met at the mall. A couple of stupid kids who had not yet learned the difference between lust and love. At least, that's how I saw it.

I *loved* the way her curly brown hair bounced up and down on my mom's basement couch. 

I *loved* the feeling of my lips on that soft spot between her shoulder and neck.

I *loved* the sound of her whispers and little gnaws on my ear.

I *loved* the smell of her cinnamon perfume.

But those were just sensations. Something on the surface that might have sparkled and shined in my young mind, sure, but... Did it mean anything? To either of us? We had nothing in common. That was clear. I was a book worm; a classic example of a kid who kept his eyes on the prize. College was my excuse to get out. Layla said she had not applied. She was a self-proclaimed Satanist who spent her Saturdays with her five favorite slasher films. She didn't even go to my school.

*""It's a Catholic school,""* she would say, her voice dripping with irony. *""Just past the state line.""*

She was a crazy kid. The type that claimed a rough childhood and reflected it in every unhealthy habit she could find. She talked about drugs a lot, and had tried everything just about everything once.

*""Sometimes it's fun to try and see if there's a God,""* was her explanation.

She smoked Camels, the pink ones, and they gave her voice an unattractive rust.

*""I'm not the girl who wants to meet your mom,""*

She said that a lot too. So the first time we had sex, she snuck into my basement after two. After that, Layla became my addiction.

I found myself needing her every weekend. That was mandatory. We had a meetup every Saturday, halfway between both of our houses on the freeway where we sat, and talked, and had sex. Without that, it always felt like I was missing something in my life. I was tired, cranky; angry, even. 

My parents had noticed a change in me, and had begun to worry about my tanking grades. Mom had asked about the scars on my back, and the smell of smoke on my jacket. Dad wanted me to keep my eyes on the prize. 

The stress started to stack up for a kid of seventeen. One weekend, Layla asked me if I wanted to meet her friend. 

It was the source of a lot of arguments at the time - the distance of two hours between our houses made it tough for us to hang out like a normal couple. Layla did not have a car, and I only had a learner's permit. But on my eighteenth birthday, I got full privileges on my out-of-state license. That meant it would be easy to borrow my dad's Buick without too much suspicion.

I caved after a couple weeks and lined up my alibis perfectly. 

Sean was my best friend, and he was the only one who had any idea of my budding relationship. His parents were cool, and understood most of the situation. They agreed to back me up when my parents called, to make sure I was actually sleeping over their house.

Friday night, I hopped in the Buick and began the two-hour trip.

The drive down to Layla's place was perfect. It was Autumn, and the leaves of the deep South fell in shades that covered the swamps and bayous like blankets. Her town was a familiar one, and it was fortunate that one stretch of road took me the whole way there. It had just started to get dark as I pulled into the driveway of the address she gave me.

The house was empty and quiet. There wasn't a car in sight, and the only light I could see then came from the over-sized porch. But part of me had expected that. I knew Layla's parents were out of town, and that she might have told me to come over before her friend. My thoughts were admittedly in the gutter as I ran up the stone steps to the big red door and knocked. 

In seconds, Layla was at the door in her best red lace. Her thin frame curved ever so slightly when she cocked her hips the right in a tease and crooked her finger towards me in a sultry beckon. 

*""Come on in,""* she said with a modest giggle.

I must have drooled like a dog. In seconds we were pressed against the wall with the front door still wide open. My lips were on her chest and my hand was between her thin little legs before she finally put up her hand and said *wait*.

That was when the alarm bells went off.

The lights were definitely off. Every single one. But we could still see, and that was thanks to a hundred cheap candles and incense sticks lined up at every corner. The whole place reeked like a mottle of smells like cinnamon, vanilla, and lavender. It was hard not to gag on the spot.

There were pictures on the walls, too - frames and frames of a happy family with six kids that all smiled and looked nothing like Layla. I had seen this movie before, so it was with a total lack of surprise when I asked if she actually lived here.

*""Nope,""* was all she said.

I turned to leave.

*""W-w-wait,""* she laughed and grabbed my hand before she slid a finger in her mouth. *""It's my friend's house""*.

At this point, if I thought with my brain over my pants, so much could have been avoided. But that was easier said than done for a seventeen-year-old.

The place was huge, but creepy. The front room was a hallway of sorts, with a big open staircase at the top and paths to the den and kitchen on the bottom. It was not long before Layla and I were interlocked and moving deeper inside.

*""There's a bedroom upstairs.""*

She slammed the front door closed when she said that, and tugged on my hand. As we walked up, there was a creak and groan in every floorboard. The lack of light played tricks on my eyes as they tried to adjust. Every time I thought I saw something, Layla would pull on my hand harder. Her hips swung back and forth when she was in a hurry. Those drew my wide-eyed attention as she pulled open the last door on the left and stepped inside. 

Then she turned, and bit softly on the bottom of my lip. I loved it when she did that. She grabbed a hold of my belt and walked backward, falling onto the bed with me and giggling as the whole thing blew up a plume of dust. It was disgusting, like it hadn't been slept in months. But one hand found her face and the other found the cool skin behind her waist, and I stopped worrying.

Sometime later, a noise downstairs told me we weren't alone.

It sounded like the clapping of a closing door. My gut said was that someone was back home, so I pulled on my clothes in a hurry, cursing under my breath and begging Layla to do the same. She just laughed at me, dancing back and forth half naked as she did.

*""He's here, silly! He's here, he's here!""

Then she shouted, ""Husband?! We're upstairs!""

As if in response, two heavy feet started up the staircase. I was panicking, cursing even louder as I tried to jam open the old window in the bedroom. It was at least a fifteen foot drop, but that felt worth the risk right about then. 

Layla never talked about a husband. Then again, how much had she really ever said about herself? I didn't know the name of her school. I never met any of her friends, or her parents, or coworkers. This was not her house. Hell, no one even knew where I was besides Sean, and he didn't have the address. All of those facts came crashing down on me in that moment.

When the steps got to the top, they headed down the hall in a hurry. Layla continued to dance as the door swung open.

In stepped an old man. He wasn't particularly remarkable - he wore a professional brown suit, with long graying hair that was held back in a neat ponytail. His belly was protruding a bit, and he was the owner of a bushy mustache that made him cartoonishly resemble a walrus. 

""Oh, Layla honey, is this what you have been up to?"" he said with a sigh.

I turned to look at the woman I *loved*, but found her to be nothing like she was. 

In place of long, flowing auburn hair was stringy, semi-attached pieces of gray. Layla's perfect skin and flawless breasts were replaced by sags and wrinkles that were ingrained into every fold, and that withered skin made soft suckling noises against itself as she continued to dance back and forth.

Her teeth were gone, and in their place were gaping, empty gums. They sucked together, mashing a sickly sound as her giggles grew harsher and deeper. The smell of cinnamon that had become synonymous with sex was now overwhelming; enough to make me sick. 

*""I bought him for you! We can be young again, baby!""* she said to her apparent husband.

The man smiled with Layla, and wrapped his arms around her in an embracing bear hug. When they kissed, they whimpered and covered each other with wet slopping sounds that sent my stomach turning all over.
 
They were distracted, so I worked harder at the window. In a moment, it was open. Without a second's hesitation I launched myself through it. 

At a twenty foot drop, I was bound to break something. But I had watched enough TV to know it was probably better to keep my feet underneath me. So when I landed, both legs were both definitely broken. At least it wasn't my neck.

Layla screeched from the window. She looked like she thought about jumping herself before she flew from sight and presumably went for the flight of stairs. I dragged myself to my car, the old Buick that my dad had let me borrow for keeping my eyes on the prize. I cried then, thinking about my mom and how I would never see her again. It was almost impossible to lift up for the handle and use it as a pull up bar. But adrenaline was coursing through my veins. I screamed as the shattered bones of my knees lifted off the ground and into the curve of my car seat. When I was halfway, Layla's husband opened the front door.

He was naked now too, and his eyes had turned a reddish color as they found my pitiful shape in a puddle by the car handle.

*""Don't be afraid,""* he shouted with a suave, confident chuckle. He stepped forward cautiously, keeping his eyes on me with his arms outstretched. *""It won't even hurt a bit.""*

That was all the motivation I needed. In seconds, I lifted myself fully into the car and closed it's door, locking it behind me. Layla was out the door as well now, and both of them were approaching the front of the Buick like they were going to block it. I threw the car in reverse, dodging them perfectly as they reached out long nails that tried to grab hold of the grill. 

With some luck on my side, the couple fell flat on their face as I peeled out of the driveway and hit the gas in horrible pain. Their screams followed me all the way to the highway.

-----

I never told anyone but Sean about what I saw. When I got home, I honked my horn and fell out of my car in a heap. My parents came rushing out and immediately called an ambulance. I was treated for the broken legs, which required several surgeries. My Mom wanted to know how something like this could happen, so I made up an elaborate story about hiking and falling off a short cliff. Sean backed me up, once I told him the truth about Layla. 

Until now, he was the only one who knew the actual story.

I threw away my cell phone. I told my parents it was time to be responsible, and signed up for my own plan with a brand new number. They liked that, and it was a quick and dirty way to cut that horrible woman from my life; in case she ever tried to contact me again.

Even now, years later, it is hard to forget her horrible old face. And it still worries me that Layla knows the way to my parents' place[.](https://old.reddit.com/r/MattRichardsen/)",11,1527809564.0,8njcrj,250,My Ex is Much Older,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8njcrj/my_ex_is_much_older/,2018-05-31 19:32:44

"EDIT: I'm sorry, but there's no proper TL;DR version of this. The closest you'll get is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/8nibp8/theory_nergigante_is_not_what_you_think_spoilers/dzvyxqj/) comment, but other than that I'm afraid it's just a long and slightly wordy discussion. Don't say I didn't warn you. 

Nergigante. The apex predator, the ruthless killer of elder dragons‚Ä¶ or is it? In the Monster Hunter community it‚Äôs generally accepted that Nergigante is a hunter of elder dragons, but today I‚Äôd like to share a theory that suggests this might not be the whole story. Bear with me, because it‚Äôs going to be a fairly long post, but hopefully you‚Äôll at least get to see some ideas you may not have considered before.  

Anyway, let‚Äôs begin with what we know about the newest flagship monster in Capcom‚Äôs beloved series. I‚Äôll start by addressing the obvious point: Nergigante is the ‚ÄòEater of Elders‚Äô. Although Monster Hunter does have a good track record of exaggerated monster titles (Deviljho the ‚ÄòWorld Eater‚Äô, anyone?), this one at least is not lying to us. In one cutscene, the Chief Ecologist says the following:  

> *‚ÄúBased on the evidence you provided, we‚Äôve figured out what it feeds on‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs elder dragons. Shocking, yes, but true. Nergigante feeds on elder dragons.‚Äù*  

So we can be fairly confident that Nergigante feeds on elders. But what do we actually know about the elders? To answer this question, we need to look at the mysterious elder crossing, the regular-ish migration of elder dragons from the old world to the New World. Let‚Äôs take a look at what the seeker has to say after the conclusion of the main story:  

> *‚ÄúPerhaps [Xeno‚Äôjiiva] was what first drew the aging elders here, to satisfy its cravings for energy.‚Äù*  

Now, that may be speculation on the part of the Seeker but it‚Äôs not the Xeno‚Äôjiiva part that interests me. Instead, what stands out is the mention of aging elders. It seems like the characters know that the elder dragons making the crossing are old ones. And this is supported in part by the role of Zorah Magdoros in the story. Zorah comes to the New World to die, and the Commission attempt to make sure that doesn‚Äôt happen in the Everstream. Remember Zorah Magdoros, because we‚Äôll return to it later on.  

Well, now we can be confident that Nergigante eats elder dragons, and that the elder dragons in the New World are not exactly young and spritely. So what‚Äôs my whole theory even about, isn‚Äôt it fairly clear that Nergigante hunts and kills these older elders? Actually, no. Far from it, in fact. Let‚Äôs take a moment to remind ourselves how Monster Hunter as a series likes to deal with predator-prey relationships. [Here‚Äôs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv2VPD8J3Ww) Deviljho‚Äôs infamous introduction in Monster Hunter Tri and 3 Ultimate, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-G2yrtL6lk) is Great Jagras being introduced as it swallows a Kestodon whole. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMqAe9pASUU) is Anjanath killing and eating a Great Jagras. There are, of course, other examples of the series handling death in situations other than predator and prey scenarios. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtaNRG0tJ4g) is Zinogre tossing Iodrome over to be eaten by its own pack, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhrsUL-T1ag) Brachydios can be seen killing Agnaktor in what amounts to a turf war before they were cool. Even if we choose to focus on things other than cutscenes, we get a similar story. In World, for example, we are told that Deviljho ‚Äúhunts species to extinction‚Äù. In short, Monster Hunter is not a series to shy away from showing death in an ecosystem. Monster Hunter: World in particular has such a huge focus on portraying just such a living, breathing ecosystem that it formed a large part of the marketing campaigns, as I‚Äôm sure you all remember.  

So then, in a series like that we might expect a predator-prey relationship between Nergigante and the elders to be either shown to us (by a cutscene perhaps, or an ecology video) or outright confirmed by other means (think monster notes or NPC dialogue). But when you start to dig through the dialogue regarding Nergigante and the cutscenes that involve it, you might be surprised to find that not once is such a relationship confirmed. We get nuggets of information that could be interpreted as Nergigante being an elder killer (such as its diet, of course), but nothing like the confirmation we get for other monsters in the series. What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs not as if Capcom didn‚Äôt have the opportunity to slip this in somewhere. Nergigante is a pretty major part of the main story, and there‚Äôs a good few paragraphs of dialogue to go through. It strikes me as odd that, in a series so unafraid of handling death in an ecosystem, Nergigante only ever gets vague comments by way of addressing this question.  

Despite this, there is one offhand comment that stands out. Again, this is our friend the Chief Ecologist speaking:  

> *‚ÄúIt does explain why we only see Nergigante during Elder Crossings and also why it hunted Zorah Magdoros so relentlessly.‚Äù*  

There we go, Nergigante hunted Zorah Magdoros! Case closed, no? Again, not quite. While it is true that ‚Äòhunt‚Äô is defined as ‚Äòpursue and kill a wild animal for sport or food‚Äô, it has another definition: ‚Äòsearch determinedly for someone or something‚Äô. And what do we see Nergigante do? We see it follow and search for Zorah Magdoros. On two separate occasions, an encounter with Zorah is interrupted by the arrival of Nergigante, almost as if Nergigante has been following Zorah from a distance. And when we drive Zorah Madoros away, the Handler has this to say about Nergigante:  

> *‚ÄúNergigante‚Ä¶ the only one who wants to find Zorah Magdoros more than we do. *  

That sounds like a search to me. Nergigante‚Äôs behaviour around Zorah coupled with this line of dialogue certainly make me think that the word ‚Äòhunt‚Äô was referring to this kind of search. But maybe that‚Äôs pushing it a little, to use a secondary definition just to point out ambiguity. If that thought occurred to you, I can‚Äôt say I blame you one bit. But consider for a moment the name of the franchise: Monster Hunter. Consider the term the game uses when it wants to stress that you have free choice in a quest: ‚Äòhunt one Anjanath‚Äô means ‚Äòcapture or kill one Anjanath‚Äô. The game itself uses the word ‚Äòhunt‚Äô to show ambiguity, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to consider the same thing happening with Nergigante hunting Zorah Magdoros.  

Even if you don‚Äôt quite buy into that idea, the alternative is that Nergigante was going to kill Zorah Magdoros. But come on, take a look at the size of them! As well as being a walking/swimming volcano, Zorah‚Äôs only known weak spots (the magma cores) will cool once destroyed to the point where even weapons made of Nergigante parts can‚Äôt damage them, so what exactly was Nergigante going to attack? And when Nergigante lands on Zorah‚Äôs back, it flails around a bit (seemingly to attack Zorah) but no damage is done to Zorah during the process. What‚Äôs more, Nergigante will fly off again with or without the intervention of our hunters. I don‚Äôt know about you, but that doesn‚Äôt put me in mind of a potential Zorah Magdoros predator.  

So what was Nergigante doing? Following a large, dying elder from a distance suggests to me that Nergigante was planning on scavenging from the body once Zorah Magdoros had died. This is somewhat supported by a line from the Handler:  

> *‚ÄúBecause to Nergigante, the Elder Crossing is an all-you-can-eat buffet. A buffet that‚Äôs packed to the scales with energy stores! Thing is, Nergigante didn‚Äôt get a chance to have its main course when we lured Zorah Magdoros out to sea. So it‚Äôs gone to the Elder‚Äôs Recess to find other elder dragons to snack on.‚Äù*  

With that, the Handler tells us that Nergigante‚Äôs main plan for feeding was Zorah Magdoros. If it was going to kill Zorah, then us driving Zorah away hardly makes a difference and Nergigante would still have been able to feed on it. Nergigante can fly, remember.  But to me, this idea that it now has no opportunity to feed as planned strongly supports the scavenger theory.  
 
That line also brings us rather nicely to one of the biggest obstacles to this theory: Nergigante‚Äôs aggression towards other elder dragons. Why would a scavenger be so intent on chasing down the elders at every opportunity? Let‚Äôs take a look.  
 
Alright, I‚Äôll start by getting some things out of the way. When Nergigante, deprived of its main meal, goes on the prowl for more food the other elder dragons (with the exception of Vaal Hazak, who is totally unaffected by this whole thing and won‚Äôt be mentioned again until later) were observed to relocate from the Elders Recess to the Ancient Forest and the Wildspire Wastes. The implication is that the elders are hiding from Nergigante, and indeed this is suggested by the Commander, who mentions *‚Äúelder dragons fleeing Nergigante‚Äôs wrath‚Äù*.  However, this is not the whole story. Firstly, the Commander also says the following before that part of the dialogue:  

> *‚ÄúAs you all know, when Nergigante descended into the Elder's Recess‚Ä¶ It stirred up a veritable hornet's nest. Being that Nergigante feeds on elder dragons, you can imagine that every monster in the recess got spooked. Initially, I thought we could nip this problem in the bud by eliminating Nergigante, but unfortunately, that's not the case. Despite our best efforts the situation has escalated.‚Äù*  

So the elders do not settle down again once Nergigante is eliminated‚Ä¶ hmmm. Secondly, the elders do not relocate to an area they‚Äôre not comfortable in. Teostra is known to be native to deserts, and Kushala Daora is known to inhabit environments similar to the Ancient Forest. They didn‚Äôt flee their homes so much as they fled their bedrooms and headed for their living rooms, and that‚Äôs not exactly a sign of a panicked creature. Thirdly, Nergigante doesn‚Äôt follow the elders when they relocate. If it‚Äôs desperately hunting them down for food you‚Äôd think it would be capable of flying the short distance from the recess to the wastes to snag a Teostra for dinner, but Nergigante never invades elder quests in these other locales. It‚Äôs not like Nergigante can‚Äôt go the wastes, since we fought it there in the demo and we know that it [killed a Barroth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcxCgzgKmKc) there. So why doesn‚Äôt it follow? To me, this is again suggestive of an opportunistic scavenger. It stalks the recess hoping to catch a dead or dying elder, but won‚Äôt follow the livelier ones in order to hunt them, even when it‚Äôs desperate for food as in the story.  

And finally, the elephant in the room. The turf wars vs [Teostra]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV-GJIqSh-4), [Lunastra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vkd3dtMR1WQ) and [Kushala Daora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjkGoTPrH5M). Surely these show a definitively victorious Nergigante, capable of wiping the floor with these elders? I‚Äôd argue not. In order to see this, we have to take a look at the mechanics of turf wars and of these ones in particular. To me, there are two things that are unusual about these turf wars. The first thing is the fact that both monsters involved take damage, and the second is that neither monster is toppled by the turf war (by this I mean that neither monster ends the turf war in the ‚Äòtripped‚Äô state). Amongst all the other turf wars in the game, these traits are highly unusual. In fact, they only appear elsewhere in four other turf wars. [Teostra vs Kushala Daora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyoYU2yRCyA), [Lunastra vs Kushala Daora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1a_B-peWvI), [Deviljho vs Bazelgeuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z2VDzF2frQ) and [Barroth vs Jyuratodus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E92SA13P7g). In light of this, I‚Äôd argue that those two turf war features are Capcom‚Äôs way of showing some level of equality between monsters. While the animations for Nergigante‚Äôs turf wars make it clear that Nergigante holds the upper hand in terms of sheer strength, Capcom has put in place mechanics that tell a different story, that muddy the waters and leave us in some doubt as to whether it‚Äôs such a clear victory after all. But maybe I‚Äôm overthinking it, perhaps the reason Nergigante takes damage at all is because the animation demands it. Not at all, as it turns out. Here‚Äôs [Vaal Hazak vs Odogaron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV5mDJa9SuE). You‚Äôll notice that although Odogaron appears to be holding its own initially, even taking two bites at Vaal Hazak‚Äôs head/neck, Vaal Hazak takes no actual damage and Odogaron ends the turf war in the tripped state. To me, that proves that Capcom absolutely made the conscious decision not to have the turf wars with Nergigante be as clear cut as they could be.  

As a quick side note, it should be mentioned that the turf wars make it apparent that Nergigante has no innate elderseal ability, contrary to the speculation of some. None of the elders will have their aura deactivated by the turf war if they start it with the aura up, and Lunastra even manages to get off a supernova-esque attack. Side note over, let‚Äôs continue.  

Now, the more knowledgeable of you out there may be aware that damage taken in a turf war inflates based on monster HP, hence the videos of regular Bazelgeuse dealing a hug amount of damage to tempered Deviljho. Using base HP values from Kiranico, in the turf war I linked above both Nergigante and Teostra lose around 45% of their base HP. Obviously the exact value will be different due to quest modifiers, but the rough percentages will remain around the same as one another. So not only does Nergigante take damage, it loses around the same proportion of its health pool as Teostra does.  

This begs the question: why? Why not show Nergigante indisputably dominate the other elders if it‚Äôs meant to be the elder killer? My answer: because it‚Äôs not meant to be the elder killer. It‚Äôs meant to be the desperate elder scavenger, only taking on the elders because it feels forced to. And what‚Äôs more, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unlikely that Capcom are planning on having a similar reveal of this in a possible G Rank expansion. It would be a plot twist, but all the clues are there. Capcom are deliberately avoiding making Nergigante an elder killer in order to have a dramatic reveal in future iterations of the series.  

Of course, that‚Äôs just my own theory and speculation (especially the part about a planned reveal, that‚Äôs just me having fun with this idea). I‚Äôm simply joining the existing dots in the way that I feel makes the most sense, and naturally other people will see it differently. I‚Äôd be interested to hear your thoughts on this, since I think it has the potential to be an intriguing lore discussion.

"### The VeChainThor Vision

##### *Building a trust-free and distributed business ecosystem platform to enable transparent information flow, efficient collaboration, and high-speed value transfers.*

##### *VeChainThor will be the platform to support Blockchain-based business applications offering real economic and social value.*

### 0. [Why invest in Fat Protocols] (http://www.usv.com/blog/fat-protocols) 

The Economist describes the true value proposition of Blockchain technology in their 2015 article [""The trust machine.""] (https://www.economist.com/leaders/2015/10/31/the-trust-machine) Trust is the single biggest hidden cost of doing business. Blockchain technology can establish a new trust-free sharing business collaboration model.

Data is the oil of the 21st century. Blockchain technology allows the chance to create a new world by putting data ownership and monetization in the hands of the people who generate that data. Data is the reason FAANG Stocks are insanely profitable and some of the biggest companies in the world.

Other platforms aim to accomplish the same vision however widespread adoption has been lacking to date.

### 1. Other platforms - technology focused

Ethereum by Vitalik Buterin is amazing. The first cryto-platform. It holds true to the ideals of the original crypto-community with a strong focus on decentralisation and security. It has encountered issues with scaling which are being actively worked on with Plasma, sharding, state-channels and Raiden network. Due to heavy decentralisation, it has issues with a borrowed governance structure ([EIP]( https://eips.ethereum.org/)) from Bitcoin. 

EOS by Dan Larimer is another technological masterpiece. EOS aims to be a feeless high performance blockchain and makes progress on the scalability  problem through an innovative consensus algorithm known as Delegated Proof-of-Stake. The benefits of EOS are achieved by sacrificing other elements and reflects a philosophical difference between Buterin and Larimer. 
 

Buterin and Larimer have had some back and forth regarding their respective platforms which delivers insight into the minds of these two geniuses. Most of their disagreements hinge on the Scalability Trilemma which has been [documented here.] (https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ)

1. [Vitalik Buterin's original article] (https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/03/28/plutocracy.html)

2. [Dan Larimer's reply] (https://medium.com/@bytemaster/the-limits-of-crypto-economic-governance-9362b8d1d5aa)

3. Buterin's reply is seen as the 1st comment in Larimer's medium post

Ethereum and EOS are innovative and have laid the groundwork for the future technological development. Other platforms such as Cardano, Stellar, NEO and NEM are making strong progress as well.  However a common theme amongst these platforms are their focus on technological development rather than development of real-world use cases. They are hoping their communities will build use cases which has led to an explosion of ICOs and dApps. Sadly, only a small amount of real world value and utility has been generated from these to date. 

### 2. VeChainThor - use case focused
	
VeChainThor has a different philosophy compared to other platforms. From the white paper, ""The ground rule of VeChain technology development is to be driven by applications. Use cases drive product development and product development drives technology development.  ‚Äì  NOT the other way around."" 

[""You've got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology, you can't start with the technology and try to figure out where you're going to sell it"" - Steve Jobs 1997]
(https://youtu.be/FF-tKLISfPE?t=1m50s)

VeChain started with the customer (enterprises) and built solutions for their business needs. In 2016 VeChain began work on four use cases with major enterprises across the globe. In 2017, the number reached to over 20, including significant
partnerships. Now, in early 2018, more than 210 opportunities are in the pipeline. Three ICOs have already been announced (BitOcean, Plair platform & Mustangchain). DBET will be migrating their existing network from Ethereum to VeChain. Once main-net launches, we will see how many more projects become public. Existing consortium chains will also migrate onto the public VeChainThor protocol.

With other platforms being open source, technological innovation can be integrated into the VeChainThor network rapidly through the balanced Governance model. [Multicoin Capital write a great blog post about this.] (https://multicoin.capital/2018/04/25/good-artists-copy-great-artists-steal/) VeChain's consensus algorithm Proof of Authority is [not original] (https://poa.network/). Their consortium blockchain was based off Ethereum. VeChainThor will continue to stand on the shoulders of giants by ""discovering truth by building on previous discoveries"". 

The core business development philosophy is the key differentiating factor between VeChainThor and other platforms. Enterprises won't adopt new technology if they don't see a clear benefit. Enterprises don't care about technological details, they care about their problems and an affordable solution. Smart money like PwC, DNV-GL and Breyer Capital understand this. 

____________________________________________________________

If anyone is interested, I can add to this post with information about how VeChainThor plans to overcome the barriers for global enterprise adoption. It's more detail about the Governance model, Economic model, Architecture and Applications, Regulatory compliance and Use cases & Applications. However, now that the [Whitepaper] (https://cdn.vechain.com/vechainthor_development_plan_and_whitepaper_en_v1.0.pdf) is out, please read it to understand the scope of what VeChainThor is planning to accomplish. Happy to answer any questions from the /r/CryptoCurrency community.

"This is a short, slightly wholesome MC;

So, since my handwriting is utter crap, a few other students and I are allowed to use laptops to type our IGCSE exams. We type out the exam completely, then print it out afterwards, then staple it to the sheet.

Anyways, after my english exam, I went to print my paper. One of the other candidates \(T\) also went to print as well. I printed mine without problem, but for T, his computer just wouldn't print. So, the examiner there was like ""Alcyona, let T print on your laptop""

At the beginning of every exam, the following phrase is read to us "" You are now under exam conditions and must follow the rules detailed on the ‚ÄòNotice to Candidates‚Äô posters you can see in the room. You must not communicate with, ask for help from, or give help to any other candidate in the exam room. "". Being the good, proactive student I was, I repeated the rule to the examiner, and claimed that she was ordering me to go against IGCSE rules that she had read out to us.

"Just played a game against Hellion where I was being a hero and stalled out 2 separate fights on 1 hp. My entire party went down but me and I managed to drive the behemoth off both times by being very careful and only attacking when safe. The second fight started about about 25 mins in and again my party was downed. The Hellion was getting low, but I was one guy doing anything not to get hit, but eventually I go down. I had kept my revive all this time so I used it and the Hellion flees.

At this time it's 29 minutes and I'm still alive, the danger goes back down and I can revive my team and we can fight again, but that doesn't matter because the devs decided that 30 minutes is enough. I pick everyone up and the game ends in the most disappointing way possible, time out.

The reason why I'm making this post is because I feel the 30 minute timer is responsible for spoiling the most epic fight I've had in this game. My hands were shaking. I'm carrying the success of this fight on my shoulders. Just me and this Bohemoth. My team was loving it and I come out on top, only to have my victory taken from me. It doesn't even feel like I lost, it feels more like I was plucked from any chance of seeing that battle to the end. The bohemoth didn't beat me and I didn't kill it, it is still out there. I've been robbed of my glory.

So devs, please make 30 mins a sudden death, one hit KO, 100% danger, perma enraged, whatever! Just don't take the outcome into your own hands. It's worse than losing.",127,1527796167.0,8nhroy,231,"30 minutes should be sudden death, not game over.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dauntless/comments/8nhroy/30_minutes_should_be_sudden_death_not_game_over/,2018-05-31 15:49:27

"Most of us already know about Horikoshi's love for the Star Wars series. From the Dagobah park and the Wookies shopping mall, there are quite a few shout-out locations throughout the series. This post actually does a good job pointing out most of them: https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/6njgwo/my_hero_academia_manga_is_filled_with_star_wars/. Gran Torino is the ultimate example of this since even Horikoshi himself has admitted that he was based on Yoda. 

>However, after glancing through the unofficial timeline post made by chaotickairos, I started to realize that Horikoshi's love of Star Wars may have bled more into the story than I thought. It had suddenly hit me that I already see the big references he's going to make in the future which will affect the overarching plot of the story. *(This is going to get looong, and I apologize for that, but for those who don't want to read the whole thing, I'll go back and just Bold the important stuff).*

Now, before I begin, we need to go over how the school system in Japan works and how far along that path MHA is in the story. In Japan, a year of school usually includes with 3 individual terms each. To quote chaotickairos's post:

>>*Term 1 starts in April, usually the second week, and runs to mid-late July. Students usually have August and sometimes parts of surrounding months off.*

>>*Term 2 starts in September and runs to late December. Winter break is usually the last week or December and first week of January.*

>>*Term 3 runs from January to late March, when we have a break before the school year starts.*

As of right now, the story is getting close to the end of the 2nd term of year 1, right before Winter Break. So, we haven't even finished the first year of the story yet, and still have 2 more terms to go. The end of the 2nd *year* is going to be the focus of my discussion today. Now, as I'm sure many of you are sick of by now, anytime a sequel or part of a story reaches a dark turn, ending with the heroes losing, many are quick to call it the ""Empire Strikes Back of...."" **However, I believe that Horikoshi is planning to intentionally parallel MHA's ""second act"" to Empire Strikes Back.**

>There are quite a few reasons for this, which each bleed into each other. To start off, my first hint at this is the eventual success of the villains. It can be assumed that eventually the villains are going to make a HUGE win. Of course not anytime soon, but later down the line. While killing All Might is the obvious suggestion, and I personally believe that will be part of it, I think it will include something else on a larger scale. 

We all know Shigaraki is set to parallel Deku as each becomes the greatest villain and hero respectively. However, Shigaraki is going to need to cover a lot of ground in order to claim that title. To surpass the bar set by All For One, he's not just going to need to impact the story's hero, but it's society and government as well. While killing All Might would certainly be a terrible blow to moral of the hero society, I don't believe that is quite enough to earn the title of greatest villain of all time. He is going to have to do something else on a larger scale that may very well extend beyond the borders of their country. Whatever this is, it needs to send shockwaves throughout the country to such an extent that people are afraid to even go outside. 

>However, Shigaraki has quite a ways to go before he's anywhere near that threshold. If he really wants to live up to that title both in the context of the story and outside from our perspective, he's going to have to take a page out of the Joker's book and focus more on the mental assault of our heroes and contort how the society views them. Case and point: if Dabi does turn out to be a Todoroki, you bet that they're going to use Endeavor's past with his wife and kids to publicly shame him and hero society in general, especially if he is directly responsible for Dabi's burned skin.

**In any case, whatever big event eventual unfolds, it needs to happen at the same time All Might dies.** It would be Shigaraki's ultimate mind game, as he forces All Might to watch helplessly as the grand plan goes off. Then just when Deku arrives and we think he's going to save him, Shigaraki disintegrates All Might (calling it now, his final panel is going to be him smiling at Deku as he crumbles into the wind).

>**Now, I know what you're starting to think, ""Cool, but what exactly does this have to do with Empire? I get the whole villains win comparison, but what else?"" Well, I first needed to do all this set up to get to All Might dying with Izuku watching and the villains succeeding. I believe this will lead into a moment that has been set up from the very beginning and its opportunity for a Star Wars reference will be so blatantly obvious that Horikoshi will not be able to help himself:**

**Izuku is going to lose his arm after failing to avenge All Might's death.**

>They been setting him up for this ever since he first overused OFA. It would be satisfying (story-wise) to finally follow up with the cost that has been repeatedly warned about. Now, this could happen in one of two ways: either by overusing OFA or having Shigaraki start to disintegrate him, but have someone else cut off the arm before it reaches the body. Personally, I believe the first has a better story impact.

We've been told time and time again of the dangers to Izuku's arms due to continued overuse of OFA. Admittedly, he has been getting better and better at controlling his max percentage, but as we all know, if it came down to it, he would use 100% again without hesitation if it meant saving someone, just like he did with Muscular. Now while we all love Izuku for being a more logical MC than other shounen, he is still a person who is, more often than not, lead by his emotions. While he knows that he shouldn't use 100% again, if he were in a incredibly stressful situation, like say watching his life-long idol dying because he failed to save him, you can guarantee his head is not going to be in the right place. He wouldn't just be distraught, he'd be furious. While Izuku is mostly a mild and forgiving kid, it has been pointed out that he actually does harbor quite a bit of suppressed resentment. Imagine all that frustration bubbling to the surface and let loose as he reaches his lowest point, he would go nuts trying to attack Shigaraki, probably leading him to use 100% in the process.

>Following the Empire story structure, he has to lose this encounter, leading him to finally face the consequence he's been warned about the entire series. And of course, after the dust settle and things start moving towards fighting back, **Izuku would round out the reference by getting a mechanical arm (courtesy of our Hero Technician, Mei).** The best thing is that it won't feel cheap or out of nowhere because we have already seen someone in this series lose an arm and get a mechanical one to replace it with Mr. Compress.

This dramatic climax and victory for the villains would only make the rise of our heroes in their third term more exciting as their goals shift from surpassing or filling the shoes of their predecessors, but reinvigorating society and redefining the true meaning of a hero (plus completing Stain's mission to boot). Only after Shigaraki has attained his mantle as greatest villain can Izuku rise up to and defeat him to become the greatest hero.

>I just see Horikoshi as too big of a Star Wars nerd to pass these opportunities up. They just line up with the plot threads already in place so perfectly. But hey, these are just my ideas.

"Hey /r/Apple!

Ever since Apple released iOS 11.4 on Tuesday with Messages in iCloud, we've had a high number of people posting on the sub asking for help, and other queries. In order to decrease the amount of these posts, this megathread will be used. Please post all Messages in iCloud questions here. Future posts will be removed with or without a heads-up. 

**What is Messages in iCloud?**

Messages in iCloud is a new feature that allows iCloud to keep your entire message history updated and available on all your devices. Even when you set up a brand-new device. 

**What should I know?**

* You need to update to the latest iOS version (iOS 11.4), and macOS (10.13.5, whenever it comes out) in order to have this feature. 

* Your messages will take up iCloud space just as if you are syncing Photos, Notes, Contacts and etc

* When you delete a message, photo, or conversation on one device, it‚Äôs removed from all of your devices. 

* You need to have the Apple ID in iMessage match the Apple ID being used for iCloud. It doesn't need to match the iTunes/App Store ID. 

* You need 2FA enabled. Link to Apple's article about 2FA: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204915

* Messages in iCloud is turned off by default. You can turn it on by going to Settings -> Tap your name at the top -> iCloud -> Messages

* It is best to leave your devices to sync overnight while they are plugged in. 

* If nothing works, sign out and sign in to iCloud and then sign out and sign in to iMessage. 

These notes still don't answer your question? Ask away under this megathread. Again, all future posts will be removed while this megathread is active.

This way you don't have to open multiples threads to look at all the informations!

Here is an album with the leaks : https://imgur.com/a/2K4piFC.

Now here is some info I could find. Don't hesitate to tell me if you find more, or that it's not correct.

* Ace (60): I'm retired.

* Ace (40): Hey Luffy, please lend me money.
* Ace (60): Chopper, just give me a little bit, brother...

>**Oda**: Well, not sure which one would have really happened, but it would be one of these two for sure.

> **Q**: Within Big Mom's 85 children, in chapter 891, Flampe says that Katakuri is king of big brothers and that there was a king of big sisters. Then who is the king of little brothers and king of little sisters?

> **Oda**: Ehhhh, first of all, what Flampe said ""Best of "", Flampe conducted that of her own accord. She's the kind of girl that she herself goes and takes the poll to everyone. Within that, there is the big, little, brother, sister results. Here is the top 3 for each.

>  **Oda**: In any case, the respective vote tally that is able to be taken isn't equal, it's just Flampe's ""I want to be king of little sister"" play/tom foolery.

**About Smoothie :**

> **Q**: What is the power of Smoothie? She becomes so big in 894. Why? And why her sword is getting wet??  

> **Oda**: yeah...I don‚Äôt have enough page to draw these, but she has the power of Shibo Shibo no mi and she is a dehydration human. She can squeeze juice out of things and dehydrate anyone who is cut by her sword. She saves water got from somebody else and will become big after this. Then she can use those water in her body to attack. She is Strong.

**About Gear 4^th time limits and Dolfamingo in Dressrosa :**

> **Q**: After reading the manga and seeing the anime, I wonder why Luffy was unable to do anything for 10 minutes after Gear 4, but then moved around without a problem against Katakuri. Is this a plothole?  
> **Oda**: There is no limit. As long as you want to move, even if you were not able to use Haki, you could run away or fight anyway, right? In Dressrosa Luffy had help after using gear 4, so he relied on that help and saved his strength to prepare to take out Doflamingo once and for all. If he had no one to rely on, he would have still succeeded all on his own.

**About how Nami acted toward Ceasar :**

> **Q**: Nami told Ceasar, he is ""trash"" and he should ""kill himself"". Did she learn that toxic attitude from Robin's wicked tongue?  
> **Oda**: Please reread Punk Hazard. Ceasar experimented on children and drugged them. He used his subordinates like experiment mice as well. He made weapons to kill innocent people. A man like Ceasar should be dead. Nami is only truly gentle to two types of people. Lovely children and lovely women. Her disgust for Ceasar comes from the bottom of her heart.

***

**About Crocodile :** 
> **Oda** : Crocodile enjoys crocodile meat and tomatos, yet he hates ketchup. Mr.1 eats raw ham, he hates roasted pork. This is why Crocodile had so many crocodiles, he raises and then eats them.

(I'm not sure for this one)
**About Katakuri :**  

> **Oda**: His least favorite food is Ramen, and he sleep with his back against the wall, not in a bed.",201,1527822889.0,8nl6rg,157,One Piece - Volume 89 SBS Megathread,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/8nl6rg/one_piece_volume_89_sbs_megathread/,2018-05-31 23:14:49

"I was a finance clerk for three consecutive bishops.

My Sundays were a second job. My compensation was a cramped hand from writing checks, mostly for addiction and mental health treatment, not from LDS services. The recession was in full swing and 1/4 of the ward was seeking professional help, which the bishop determined was a valid use of funds.

I learned more about the members than I felt comfortable. I, despite my best efforts, knew who paid and who didn‚Äôt, and thus how much they made. 

There were many, including myself, who paid fast offerings even while unemployed. Due to the small dollar amounts I could tell folks we‚Äôre giving on gifts, and possibly just for ‚Äúblessings‚Äù.

SlC came down on the bishop cause he was paying out too much, he said blow yourselves, these people need help, and was released. The checks stopped completely.

It was not an uplifting experience.

Sometime after I was released I went in myself to tithing settlement. The bishop, I‚Äôll say he was a pipe fitter, did not understand why I, someone with advanced education in finance, closed my fiscal year in June, thus wasn‚Äôt paying in December. He insisted I pay before year end. I was completely taken aback. Why would it matter when I paid? 

I went out of town and did not return until the new year.

I was a believer still.

I moved out of the ward about a month later, and entered an enormous ward, with many well to do members. The first few weeks seemed to be solely about tithes and money and prosperity gospel shite. Then came a special combined meeting wherein the bishop had an important message.

The bishop showed PowerPoint slides with charts of global church fast offering trends 2008-2012. No numbers were specified.

Expenditures increased and the increase in donations had slowed over a period of several years, to which the bishop commented ‚Äúwhat would happen if this continued?‚Äù.

Apparently the increased need for fast offerings was due to a lack of faith and folks not keeping the sabbath holy.

Well, the Brethren doubled down on sabbath adherence and lo and behold the trends went back to pre 2008 ratios.

No mention of the recession. I was impressed that people had continued to give as much as they had, that part was actually increasing.

I though ‚Äúwhat the hell are they for if not to be used‚Äù? And I wondered where did the fast offering margin in past years go?

Well, now I guess we know.

Swore I‚Äôd never give another dime. 

That was the last straw for my wavering beliefs. The red pill was swallowed and I was done.

This leak has stirred up memories and my anger is hot again.

Shame on the church for bleeding and humiliating their members, for accepting tithes and offerings from social security, and from the unemployed, and stealing from the mouths of hungry children, all under the promise that the windows of heaven will open. 

TLDR: I was a finance clerk, saw how the church cracked down on the use of fast offerings, and lost my beliefs when the bishop bitched about people having so little faith they would ask for assistance.

"My mom has MD and diabetes. She is permanently wheelchair bound and has aids that come in every day while I'm at work or getting other things done.

Today was probably the worst it's ever been. Her home help aid showed up 2 hours late without telling the company she works for. In turn my mother wet her bed. She then proceeded to sleep and play on her phone for half an hour before she would take care of the wet bed/taking my mom to the bathroom and a shower.

When it came about 15 minutes before the aid was supposed to leave my mom was asking for her pump supplies and she wouldn't get them for her resolulting in her blood sugar going up to 400. 

The aid then got mad at my mom because she wouldn't sign the paper ( which confirms the hours she's there)  for the aid because she was only there for 1/2 the time she was supposed to be there and she wanted to be paid for the full thing.

She left my mom in her wheel chair with no lunch no pump supplies and didn't call anyone to say she just left her there.

What can I do about the aid/company, my mom doesn't want to file a police report but I feel it's something that needs to be done because something like this should never happen and the company doesn't give 2 shits.

Edit: Filed a report with APS against the aide and the company. Also called a lawyer but they said there's not enough to sue them.

Also the case worker is trying to find a different company to provide in home health services.",56,1527779492.0,8ngedu,695,Home Aid abusing my mother.,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8ngedu/home_aid_abusing_my_mother/,2018-05-31 11:11:32

"FTP and on mobile.

Yesterday, I went into my local grocery store to pick up a few things. It was the middle of the day so the place was pretty slow. As I head to check out I notice all the lines are pretty short. I also see one of my favorite cashiers working so I hop in their line. 


A lady hops in line behind me and starts tapping her foot at me as I am putting my stuff on the belt. I‚Äôm not sure why, as there are still 2 people in front of me but I shrug it off finish putting my stuff up and scooch it all together so she can start loading her groceries onto the belt. I also put a divider on the belt for her because I was raised right.


As the line moves forward this lady immediately starts shoving her cart into my butt to push me forward. Now I am not in her way at all, but even if I were there‚Äôs quite a few better ways to get someone to move. So I plant my feet and lean slightly back to push her cart off of me. I also step forward but leave an appropriate amount of space between me and the person in front of me.
But that was not good enough for the woman behind me because she starts shoving her cart into me again and when I turn around to glare at her she waves her hands at me in a ‚Äúmove forward‚Äù motion. 
So I bump her cart back into her with my super strong booty. 


I then get to the front of the line and knowing that the lady behind me was in a rush and no one was in line behind her I take my sweet time looking for my card. Then I swipe it even though it was a chip reader, then I ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù pulled the card out of the chip reader too early. Once the card finally went through I requested cash back, In ones and fives. All while chatting away with the cashier who saw the whole cart pushing thing and knew exactly what I was doing and thought my pettiness was pretty funny. I spent a good minute then putting my cash, my receipt and my card back in my purse. 


On my way out I also stopped by customer service and let them know how nice the cashier was and how she didn‚Äôt make me feel rushed at all


TL;DR: Pushing people with your grocery cart is rude and will make them move slower!",8,1527825011.0,8nlh9i,61,Grumpy Grocery Grinch,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8nlh9i/grumpy_grocery_grinch/,2018-05-31 23:50:11

I've noticed this and my friends have and I've seen streamed have this issue. Loot doesn't spawn for a long time after I land and in stuck running in circles waiting for spawns. Also despite the tick rate increase I  feel like there's a lot more early game teleporting and rubber banding. Most noticeable is if you jump around a lot it seems like a lot of the jumps don't register. I still notice a lot of desync as my deaths seem to not match the kill cams. ,95,1527810805.0,8njiqo,198,There's a major issue with loot spawning late since new patch,https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8njiqo/theres_a_major_issue_with_loot_spawning_late/,2018-05-31 19:53:25

Are you kidding me? I *know* I suck at singing/dancing, so that means I know what shitty singing and dancing looks like. People who say this type of shit are just trying to make themselves look good by defending someone on the internet.

"I understand the desire to be nice. Maybe it's even a little bit to show off. Maybe you just really needed nuts and bolts. Bit enough is enough. Stop giving taxi rides.

How do you think this whole trading craze got started in the first place? Nice people trying to help newbies, but look at what happened! Global chat is useless, newbies are lurking behind every tree and rock waiting to sabotage the map unless you give them a good gun, etc etc. 

Now by bringing lowbies up to canny and twine, you are ruining playing experience of the people who legitimately play the game. There is absolutely no reason anyone needs epic/legendary perk up at an early level. Hell, it's not *necessary* at all really. It's this games equivalent of raid gear in an MMO. You know, the stuff you only get when you are at the end of the game doing the hardest content. It's supposed to be hard to get.

Not to mention in twine, the number of people playing was already fairly low. It's not uncommon to finish a map with only two people. With taxis, it seems like every other mission I get into already has someone over 50 levels below the map level there farming. It's getting rediculous that I have to start a new map on private, switch to public, and hope someone of adequate level joins.

"This was about 10 years back in my ARMY days. 

SO, part of ARMY grunt life is waking up at 0500 every morning for physical training (PT). My platoon would practice combatives(hand-to-hand) for PT at least twice a week, as it is a pretty intense workout, and keeps that skill set sharp.
Now our company commander (we'll call him Cpt. Tryhard) was a 6ft 3in 250lbs+ corn fed midwestern guy, always with a dip, a swagger, and a 'pompous hard-ass' attitude that officers tend to develop as they grow in rank. He was genuinely a pretty decent guy, but it was important to him to look good (ie bad-ass) in front of the junior enlisted, and it was pretty obvious most of the time.

By contrast, I had a very close friend (we'll call him Jim), who is all of 5ft 9in, ~130lbs soaking wet. Jim is also one of the wiriest, scrappiest, most hate filled little bastards to ever walk the earth, which is why we were good friends. (you can probably tell where this is going)

Normally, every platoon is given free reign on their PT choices, and they do PT together, just the platoon. Occasionally, one of the brass will feel like making an appearance for morale, get an itch to do some 'real' PT, or just want to show off in front of the junior enlisted. (enter Cpt. Tryhard)

One day we are setting up a circle to practice combatives for morning PT, when Cpt. Tryhard decides to join our morning session. We defer to him and set up for him to go first, and of course he spots Jim (easily the smallest guy in the platoon by a wide margin) and says 'I'll take private Jim over there.' At this point a few guys are whispering complaints, 'that's some bullshit' etc, and from the immediate reaction on his face, I can tell even my Sgt thinks this is shitty. But he just looks up with a subtle smirk and says 'alright Jim, you're up.' (there are no excuses, no 'unfair,' you just suck that shit up) So Jim steps up and we get ready for them to go at it.

Usually in a training setting, the two guys will ease forward, feel each other out a bit, and lead into grappling and holds, and what generally amounts to a bunch of rolling around looking for a pin (no striking, that is separate training, and has a higher probability of injury). Well, Cpt. Tryhard decides to open with a full speed spear, because of course he would. Jim is caught off guard, shoulder right to the midsection, and is taken off his feet. However,  one of the downsides of spearing someone like that, is that it puts you into a textbook position to be guillotine choked, and sure enough, when Jim lands on his ass, we look, and he's got the Cpt. choking purple in a perfect guillotine. Maybe 5 seconds later the Cpt. is tapping out, all of us are purple with suppressed laughter, and the Cpt. quickly makes some excuse to be elsewhere. I saw him later on in the day, and during my salute in passing I innocently asked ""how did you enjoy PT with us this morning sir?"" I was met with a very muffled 'go fuck yourself' and half-assed salute as he sped along to his next destination.

TL;DR - Giant corn fed Cpt decides to pick tiniest platoon member to practice combatives with, gets beat almost instantly, spends rest of the day (week, month, we laughed about that for awhile) pretty embarassed

edit - some words, cause I'm not great at them

"I have a home business, and must answer all calls as I never know which one is a business call. However many of them now have faked numbers. If a call is from Unknown Number, it is likely a telemarketer. One can simply not answer such calls, possibly missing out on legitimate business communications. But answering a suspicious call with silence defeats the robocalls, but the actual humans will ask if anyone is there. These days people are used to dropouts on cell calls, and will just assume there was a dropout. Of course if you hear a boiler room in the background, it is probably a telemarketer. 5 seconds of silence is enough to absolutely distinguish a human from a robot.

"As the title states, I have been going through a rough patch the past two years. I haven't been able to do anything other than eat, use the restroom, and sleep. The only reason my hair was brushed was because I saw a post on tumblr ages ago about a girl who's depression made her hair so knotted that she had to be in a salon for over 16 hours to get it saved, when she thought she'd have to have it shaved off.  


I didn't brush my teeth. I didn't clean. I didn't really cook. I didn't have a job to go to work with. I gained over 100lbs, and because of my inability to brush my teeth, I have horrible breath as a result, where normally before my depression struck me it was just average. I feel horrendous about my appearance because of my weight gain. I feel horrible because I have to slum it on my friend's couch, and I'm pretty sure she's sick of me. 

Today though, I don't know where it came from, but I gained some small semblance of confidence about being able to do something, and boy let me tell you, I had underestimated my abilities. I brushed my teeth for the first time in an eternity \(and thank the gods for that, might I add!\), I cleaned the entire living area that I have, by moving boxes to the storage unit upstairs about 10 times, vastly decreasing the populace of clutter in the living room. I did the dishes, I cooked, I did laundry, and I shaved for the first time in an eternity. It made me feel so good that I even cut my own hair \(I know how to give myself layers, it's a small quality that I learned through many years in foster care\).  All the while, my legs had constantly felt like collapsing due to the fact that I'm pretty sure the muscles have atrophied.

I feel accomplished, but I am also still very upset, I didn't expect to gain so much weight in my depression. I'm scared that I won't be able to shed the weight off, or gain any amount of my old muscles back, because while I wasn't the most fit person in the world, I also didn't feel like just walking was going to make me collapse.   


I kind of hate myself over this whole ordeal, and I can't pretend that I don't know why I became so depressed. Aside from antidepressants not working on me and only making me more of a giant slug than I already feel like I am, I lost all motivation to do anything. I don't know how to be an adult. I don't know how to keep a job. I don't know how to grow that thick skin that lets harsh remarks just bounce off. I want to be better, I want to feel better. I want to do better. 

Most of all, I just want to feel beautiful again. I used to be so vain, I used to care about how I looked, and now I couldn't give any less of a shit, and I don't mean that in an ""oh I'm going to Walmart in my pajamas"" way, I mean it in an ""I don't give a fuck about even putting effort into looking any bit decent at all, because I don't like myself anymore"" way. I want to be better...but I don't know how. 

Honestly I just yearn for that ability, to have more days like today, where before 7:30am I can get up and be productive, but I'm pretty sure that won't happen, and that breaks my heart. I know I shouldn't give up so easily about it, but it's been a long time, and I don't have any direction. I'm like a jellyfish, just floating where the waters take me, and it's scary to be in this kind of depressed state of mind.

"I was going to college full time, and had a part time job that paid minimum wage. It was the semester before my wedding. I didn't have a car, I was subsisting on whatever food was in the discount basket of my local grocery store. I didn't have significant financial support from my family. My fiance paid my last few months of rent before our marriage, otherwise I would have been homeless. I was so poor... Absolutely broke. Still, I faithfully paid tithing *and* offerings. And yet my bishop felt the need to call me into his office and shake me down for more money. I was a TBM at the time and needed him to sign off on my temple recommend for my wedding, so I did it... I paid more. I've often felt sad, frustrated and angry about the financial stress I experienced during this time of my life. I should have been saving money for my wedding (my entire wedding /reception budget was less than $1,000) but instead I was mindlessly adding to the coffers of a billion dollar corporation.

"POTUS just tweeted he will be pardoning Dinesh!!!  He's the filmmaker of ""Obama's America"" which shed light on just who Obama really is -- just prior to the 2012 election.   Many believe his prosecution on a relatively small campaign contribution violation was in retaliation for this film.  

This article tells us Dinesh recently obtained his FBI file and it showed he was ""red flagged' for being an Obama critic.

UPDATE:  Trump is considering a pardon for Martha Stewart and commuting the sentence for Blagojevich!  (Martha had to step down from running her company after her conviction -- a pardon means she could retake the helm). Take that Comey!

" So a post about the cringe of Tankies over at r/communism lamenting over the collapse of the eastern Bloc and Soviet Union garnered a very articulate rant from the comments tat I loved exceptionally. I thought it deserved attention for how astutely it seems to sum up the presented problems at hand for us Anarchists attempting to empathize with other members of our *""*leftwing*""* community.

> *""*Considering that every measurable indicator for quality of life \([that isn't some bullshit freedom index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_of_the_World), [usually designed by the CIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity_data_series), [that only measures how easy it is to cheat on your taxes or steal land from the poor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index)\) significantly declined after the fall of the Berlin wall \(and had already begun falling after Glasnost had been implemented for a couple of years\), from infant mortality to \-self\-reported happiness to daily caloric intake to sexual satisfaction \-\- considering all of that, then, yes, I am a little bit sad. I am also a little bit sad that significant financial aid for national\-liberation movements across the globe from Canada to Angola to Japan has disappeared, which in the case of Peru arguably led to the Shining Path becoming more and more culty and authoritarian, and therefore more ultraviolent and sickeningly brutal. And of course I am also quite sad that for nigh\-on thirty years the United States and its allies have been almost totally unopposed in their wholesale plunder of the globe and its people.  
>  
>But on the other hand, I'm delighted that the left\-wing has been set free of an authoritarian and murderous ideology, now proved to contain the seeds for its own destruction in its very conception. I'm happy that an environmentally\-destructive entity has been abandoned, even if for little gain. I'm overjoyed that the greatest threat to the revolution, the death\-knell of revolutions of positive social upheaval from Kronstadt to Ukraine to Manchuria to Catalunya to Cambodia to Grenada to Czechoslovakia to Hungary to East Germany to Tiananmen Square has been buried far underground.  
>  
>Those who mourn the loss of tacky red\-yellow colour coordination should cease to cry and become more loyal patrons of McDonalds. Those who mourn the end of their social\-democracy\-without\-democracy, a social\-dictatorship if you will, can rest easy with the knowledge that North Korea is still packing political dissidents into camps and handing out free methamphetamine. Those who weep over their shattered idols can still wallow in their delusion with the likes of Grover Furr, loudly proclaiming to a pack of howling capitalists and bemused socialists \-\- ""NOT ONE CRIME!"" \-\- blissfully unaware that they are mere entertainment, commodified by the liberal establishments that have enough of a deficit in taste as to house their rantings, a caricature of a caricature of an atrocity. But I refuse to join them.  
>  
>What limp and lifeless dregs remain of the Stalinists are still unaware of their own delusion: they answer loudly the logically impossible objections of the capitalists with their own fallacious fantasies. The capitalists say to them: the Holodomor happened because communism failed as an economic system, but also Stalin was a dictator who wanted to kill the Ukrainians. They cannot have it both ways. But rather than point out the failure of this two\-pronged approach, the Stalinist is compelled by their own ideology to fall into their own trap. They announce at once that the Holodomor was a naturally\-occurring famine \-\- one which the by\-now fully mechanized, fully collectivized Ukrainian economy was unable to weather without millions of deaths \-\- but also that it was caused by the Kulaks \(who had all been dead or imprisoned for 18 months at the start of the famine, and who were mostly children\) and by grain\-hoarders \(so that's why they starved, they had all that food!\). Only the anarchists and left\-communists have the correct answer to such questions: that is that Stalin was a dictator. He was a totalitarian murderer who murdered people.  
>  
>They claim that we anarchists are the sectarians, yet how many vanguard parties have populated even a tiny country like Nepal: The UCPN\(M\), the CPN\(UML\), the CPN\(ML\), the CPN\(UCM\), the CPN\(Uni*ted*\), the CPN\(MC\), the NWPP, th*e CP*N\(Unified\), and those are just the ones with seats in government. Turkey has the MKP, the MKLP, the TKEP/L, the TKP/ML, and the MLSBP. It used to be worse. The Turkish communists actually have their shit together, largely due to significant influence from the PKK. While anarchism is infinitely more varied in thought than Leninist ideology, and anarchists can't even agree on whether markets are okay, or whether we should abandon technology wholesale or all give ourselves prehensile android cocks, I honestly can't name a time when anarchists have even gotten in a fist\-fight. Has one anarchist even ever killed another over ideological disagreement? It must have happened, but I can't actually think of any concrete example.  
>  
>Engels claimed, at the end of his very clumsy dismantling of an argument nobody ever gave in ""On Authority"", that we serve the reaction. But when have we ever? Stalin claimed that we are the greatest threat to the revolution, worse than the fascists or the liberals, but which revolution was betrayed by the anarchists? The Black Army rescued Moscow from Denikin, and were butchered for it by Trotsky. The CNT\-FAI kept the whole of Spain from sweeping into the hands of the Falangists, but they were ridden down like a herd of bison in Barcelona and shot in the back in Madrid. The freed Manchu and Korean slaves and the Mutualist and AnCom revolutionaries of the Shinmin Prefecture took in Marxist refugees and radicals fleeing the nationalists in China and the fascists in Japanese\-occupied Korea, and the fiercest revolutionaries among them were assassinated by Stalinists, their equipment sabotaged, their food\-stores destroyed.  
>  
>I'm a pro left\-unity guy. I've already praised the Turkish communists, despite laughing at their alphabet soup. I wish the Naxalites nothing but success in their fledgling revolution. I think Cuba is pretty nifty. I like my local Trots a lot more than they like me. At the last May Day march, a high\-ranking Hoxhaist and I bonded over anti\-imperialism, opposition to exploitation of students in general, and disgust over US war crimes in North Korea, Vietnam, Yemen, and Syria. I have a particular soft spot for zany Maoists. The position of anarchists has always defaulted to left\-unity. Our only demand is revolution, and we will proceed with our demands regardless of whether or not the vanguard is behind us. But the vanguard almost always stops short of revolution. Their stance, more often than not, is that it is never quite the right time, the material conditions are not yet perfect, the wind is blowing the wrong way, it's raining, class consciousness has not yet been achieved. That is the nature of hierarchical power: to maintain and obtain. The peak of vanguard power is reached always at the cusp of the revolution, always at the breaking point. When the working class are at the height of their power but the depths of their despair. When the factories are being seized and the mansions are ablaze, the best the vanguard can muster is a couple of death\-squads to shoot the proletariat in the back as they fulfill the predictions and prescriptions of Marx to the letter. This is why Lenin forced the Constituent Assembly to dissolve just weeks after it was formed: the Bolsheviks only received less than 25&#37; of the vote.  
>  
>The Stalinists are right about one thing: anarchists are fools. We continue to hold out our hands for the Stalinists to bite our fingers off and then claim that anarchists always lose for lack of fingers, and that we were the aggressors, aggressively bleeding aggressive blood from our aggressive wounds. And we will continue to do so, because we're fools who believe that man can survive without a master, that husbands need not beat their wives, that parents need not abuse their children, that workers need no bosses, that citizens need no states, that we should live *in* our environment and not *against* it, that there is no need for borders, or money, or war.  
>  
>When the communists get serious about revolution, then they can grasp ahold of the hand that has stayed outstretched since Marx wrote his polemic against Proudhon. Until then, the revolution will proceed as planned, without them.  
>  
>This was longer than I intended. I just couldn't find a good place to stop until now.*""* \- u/TheMightyRocktopus

"Not sure how to flair this.

The dealership is based in Ohio. My parents live in West Virginia. The car is a 2015 Toyota Highlander. She is the 2nd owner. She bought the car used less than a year ago.

 I don't know how many oil changes she has done. All I know is the she had an oil change today with the dealership instead of the place she usually takes their car for repairs and maintenance. I asked her why, she said the person she talked to told her if she got her oil changed anywhere other than their dealership it would void the warranty. She thinks it has something to do with the fact her car uses synthetic oil. 

This doesn't sound legal to me. People change their own oil all the time. Would that void the warranty? It seems to me they are just taking as much money from her as they can. It's not an urgent issue since it's already happened but I want to make sure they aren't cheating her for next time. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

Update: I appreciate all the advice. I got to talk to my mom again and apparently I didn't have the full story. It was when she bought the car they told her she had to get the work done there for it to be covered under warranty. But the warranty was only for a certain number of miles which was passed already. So I wasn't given all of the information, they were kind of rude to her anyways, she will be taking the car to the normal place from now on. I'm frustrated with her because I've been looking into this for 2 days.  But hey, at least I have this information now. Thanks again for the help!

"Today's been crappy for a million valid reasons.

 I have counted my calories, gone to the gym , ran my best mile , I'm almost to step goal, and ten minutes ago I decided the only thing that will make feel better is cheese dip, chips , candy, and this cream cheese dessert that's so delicious. 

I saved all the ingredients to buy , loaded up, and now I'm here in the parking lot, and I'm feeling feelings. 

This is the part of weightloss that's different than just counting your calories. You have to deal with your crap. You can't just eat it and watch Netflix then feel worse. 

Even though all I want is that stupid cream cheese dessert and cheesy dip goodness, I'm going to stay within my remaining 600 calories for the day. 

I hope that one day this gets easier, and I hope you all have the courage to take a second to feel the feelings before you go into the store / through the drive through / etc.  Because this is what it's all about right ?",36,1527824879.0,8nlglt,59,I'm in the parking lot about to buy all my favorite binge foods,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/8nlglt/im_in_the_parking_lot_about_to_buy_all_my/,2018-05-31 23:47:59

"So I used to work in the line in a hotel, when I became pregnant. As a grew bigger and bigger it was a challenge  but it started to be a total nightmare, while getting into my third trimester also summer was approaching and it was going to get hotter and hotter. So I approached my chef (usually a nice guy)and asked him to move me to the cold area for  the rest of my pregnancy as blah, blah, blah, me bigger, baby hot in the belly blah, blah, blah. I honestly thought it wasn't a big deal as he was hiring new people for a busy summer anyway but he said let me ask HR

I was a little bit disappointed but I was determined not to finish all the way so I planed to go on mat leave just earlier in case they wouldn't accommodate me. 

After 2 weeks of waiting on their decision they asked me to have my doctor to filled out a form, so I went to my doctor I asked her to please restrict me because my job was mostly physical.  She told me to tell her what exactly  I wanted, so I took my note with my restrictions which included to work up to 6 hours a day.

After another week of waiting, one day they called me into a conference room with my two chefs, HR, an HR assistant and a union rep. I thought it was too odd but it turned out that my accommodation was something that came with my benefits and that working 6 hours a day put  me into sick leave benefits which made my insurance paid  80%of those 2 hours a day I was missing because of my medical restriction. 

My chef wasn't happy cause it was busy season but I was willing to work the entire pregnancy if he was just nice enough to let me work across the kitchen were the windows were but he decided to be a meanie and involve HR.

 I am very sensitive and while pregnant I was even more so I took it bad when my chef wouldn't understand I was just a pregnant woman who couldn't move fast enough to work on a busy line.  So I ended up leaving earlier, almost 2 months before my due date and got paid sick leave through my insurance before my mat leave benefits.

"[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_Joe_(TV_series\)) show  wanted to prove that personality could win over beauty.

Instead of attempting to make a ""dream couple"" between two extremely attractive people, Average Joe tried to get 16 to 18 ordinary men to win over the heart of a Stacy. The men were what the producers considered to be average in appearance.
Prior to the show's start, the Stacy was not aware she was to be dating ""average"" men. She was instead led to believe her show was going to feature only handsome suitors. Halfway through the show, several handsome suitors appear and compete against the average Joes.

And the curtain reveal: 

> The show was marketed to have an implied moral subtext, namely that beauty was only skin deep, and that personality could ultimately triumph over looks. However, **the first two seasons ended in a way that seemed to prove the opposite.**

Ohhhhh but it's not over yet. Amid backlash, they wanted to prove that men were just as shallow as women, so in the third season, they flipped the script. It was a dude (Adam) who got to date 18 average female contestants, then they would bring the attractive femoids mid-season. Guess what happened?

>  the busload of ""babes"" arriving later **were sent home immediately by Adam.** In the final episode, Adam chose saleswoman Samantha Trenk over schoolteacher Rachel Goetz. 

LMAO. BUT WAIT, there's more. At this point, people were quite angry because any show that doesn't portray femoids as a paragon of virtue and selflessness is misogynist. So they scheduled a fourth season with the original concept : 1 women, 18 initial average joes, then models getting in mid-season. But they knew the shallow hypergamous femoid would never choose the average joe, so they added a twist. From [this article](https://www.popmatters.com/average-joe-strikes-back-2005-2496237215.html) : 

> This fourth season offers a twist on that twist: each week, one of the rejected Joes gets an **extreme makeover, including liposuction, eyebrow waxing, teeth whitening, and plastic surgery.**

> Though the girls usually choose hunks, we're supposed to be rooting for the Joes. A voiceover at the beginning of Episode One claims, ""Their personalities will start to win her heart,"" while Anna gets misty over a love letter from one of them. But the makeover feature changes all that, suggesting instead that average men don't have to be average anymore. They can remake themselves to compete with the big boys. **Now, there are no average Joes. Only Joes who haven't had facelifts yet.**

The only way to make the ""average joe"" win is by giving them extensive surgery after they got immediately kicked out by the Stacy. The end of that article is wonderfully blackpilled:

> Even if a Joe does manage to get picked in the end, **Average Joes' overriding message is that all of us should ""look our best"" in order to compete in the world** , and that means norming stereotypes about beauty and traditional gender roles. Keep up or get cut. One hottie, Josh, observes, ""You know, beautiful people like to surround theirself [sic] with beautiful people,"" and another, Rocky, says, ""I didn't create this. This is the way the world is."" While the editing makes fun of their arrogance and implies these statements are too extreme, **the message here is to go pump iron. And botox.**",44,1527810863.0,8njj01,111,Bluepilled reality show tries to prove beauty is only skin deep.

Let's compare that to the decade of films they made before Toy Story 3

- 2002 - (squat)
- 2003 - **Finding Nemo**

- 2006 - **Cars**
- 2007 - **Ratatouille**
- 2008 - **WALL‚Ä¢E**
- 2009 - **Up**

That's 7 movies in 10 years. All 7 were original.

Just to be clear, I'm not pointing this out because I hate Disney/Pixar or anything. I'm actually a huge fan, and it kind of saddens me to see them doing this. 

I guess I wouldn't be that upset by this if all of the sequels they made were great, but they just don't compare to the original movies they make, and they just come off more like cash grabs. I mean c'mon... 2 Cars sequels? Are you shitting me? Was Monsters U. a story that just needed to be told?

Incredibles 2 looks dank, but I really hope they pump the brakes on the sequel factory and make more creative original movies.

With more score creeped units than any other color, including the ubiquitous red swords, it can only be considered a purposeful choice by IS that you're pulling your 20th Arthur or Merric. This is compounded by the idea that IS readjusted the summoning pool to point they were satisfied without demoting any 5 star exclusives to 4 star.


It also hurts anyone who wants variety in arena while still optimizing score, as the 4 highest scoring units in the 3&4 star pool have been available since day 1 (Effie, Draug, Sheena, Gwendolyn).

"###**So What Is The Mod Making Contest?**  
Hey folks and welcome to the new world; if you haven‚Äôt heard, public mods are here (see below for details)! The Vermintide‚Äôs Next Top Mod contest is simple. At some point in June (**Deadline: Midnight on 30 June your time**), release an original mod that alters Warhammer: Vermintide 2‚Äôs gameplay in some significant way. *Teaming up and contributing as a group is perfectly acceptable.* After the deadline, a group of experienced modders, Vermintide veterans, and Reddit moderators will collaborate to choose their top 3 favorites. The winners will receive a cool cash prize, their mod featured at the [Vermintide subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermintide/) and a Youtube showcase of their mod in action. I‚Äôm putting  $300 towards the prize pool myself, but it just might grow from there (if you are interested PM me on Discord).

The competition is for the ""best original gameplay mod"", by which we mean a mod that provides a substantially-new way to play. This could mean changing the types of challenges we face, or introducing completely new challenges and objectives. One example from Vermintide 1 would be the Deathwish mutation that added instant-death and significantly-increased the damage of enemies. You could also pursue fresh, new ideas like an ""escort the barrel‚Äù challenge or ""all ordinary attacks do zero damage, the game spawns four automatically-respawning barrels at the start, and the team must clear the mission using only these barrels"".

If you aren‚Äôt sure that your mod idea qualifies for the competition, feel free to message me at the [Vermintide Modders](https://discord.gg/gFWAJjX) Discord server.  
  
*If you‚Äôd like to participate, send me a message here or on Discord so I can get a rough head count. GLGL and I can‚Äôt WAIT to play what you guys come up with!*  
  
###**I‚Äôm Interested But Don‚Äôt Know How To Mod**  
Fortunately for us, in addition to all the work veteran Vermintide modders have done over the past few months, they‚Äôve also put together some helpful resources for new modders!

The first step to getting started is to join the [Vermintide Modders Discord](https://discord.gg/gFWAJjX) server to ask questions, find inspiration and (if you want) team up with other modders! While there, check out the resources channel. After that, visit the [Vermintide Mod Framework Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/Vermintide-Mod-Framework/Vermintide-Mod-Framework/wiki) to step through the setup and building of your very first Vermintide mod.  

###**Wait, Vermintide Has Mods Now?**  
You can check out [this page](http://www.vermintide.com/mods_guide/) for information if you‚Äôd like to get them yourselves. At the moment, mods may only be used in the ‚Äúmodded realm‚Äù; where loot and experience are disabled, but mods that don‚Äôt give a significant advantage will soon be ‚Äúwhitelisted‚Äù for use in the core game. This places us at the verge of a wholly-new way of playing Vermintide. Players will be able to customize the game‚Äôs UI and controls on a whole new level, to experiment and test with new tools, and to play missions in vastly-different ways through new ‚Äúgameplay modes‚Äù.

"I set up a one-shot for some friends who wanted to try it out.  It began with the two pc's entering 1v1 combat, as the fighter wanted to prove himself worthy of entering the temple where the monks lived.  (they were both buffed to level 3).  Suddenly mid combat the master who was overseeing the duel falls face down with an arrow in his back! BANDITS!  Everyone rushes in to help the master and fight the bandits... except the fighter.  Who raises his blade and says, ""No, this must be part of my trial, I shall not waiver from my mission!"" ... and attacks the monk...

After getting dropped to 2hp, the monk, outraged by the death of his master and this betrayal, goes into a rage and uses flurry of blows to destroy the fighter.  

The dust settles and the Monk is left the only one alive, dead bandits and monks (including his master) lay at his feat.  And this fighter, making death saving throws, grasping at life.  The monk brings down his long sword into his chest, tears running down his eyes, with a yell of frustration and anger.

The fighter looks at me, ""so am I dead?  But how?  I thought I was immortal...""

We gotta start makin' tendies

Learn to daytrade $AMD instead of going long for pennies

"Chapter 906: Holy Land Mariejois

[Picture 1](https://i.imgur.com/KqNGjhS.jpg)

[Picture 2](https://i.imgur.com/HJJM2uF.jpg)

Cover page: 10:00 Orlumbus is checking the ship for cleanliness with Columbus. (There's a Columbus too..)

The royalty are given things to ride on --Traberetors that move the ground. Stelly thinks they're under attack tho, and demands to be protected. Fukaboshi offers to take Shirahoshi to see the forest while the king goes on with the others. Though the truth is Fukaboshi has a weird feeling about the Traboreators --he doesn't know it but he's spot on as they're operated by human slaves underground.

Saint Charloss, the Tenryubito Luffy K.O'd back on Sabaody, is looking at Shirahoshi through binoculars and has fallen for her. Some of the other royalty start hitting on Shirahoshi but she's like ""You guys aren't my type."" Her brothers explain to her that she should lie and say ""Thanks"" or ""Maybe we can dine some other time"" or whatever, but she confesses she's bad at lying.


Meanwhile Vivi and Rebecca have met as well as the tonatta and are trading stories about Luffy when Shirahoshi over hears and joins in. Sai's there and it sounds like he's going to sever ties with his country, when Leo asks why a pirate would be here.

Wapol and his queen, Kinderella, are there and when he tries to start stuff with Vivi,  Dalton puts an end to that as he and Kureha have arrived. Kureha sticks to her sthitck of totally ignoring people and instead trying to explain the secret of her youth.

Aw, Rebecca asks if Dalton likes Luffy and he blushes and sorta turns aside to say it quietly that he does.

Meanwhile to Impel down: Level 6. Doffy is implying to Magellan that he's here to protect him because assassins from above have arrived. Mariejois has a secret treasure apparently and he knows about it which makes him dangerous to them so they'll have him killed so he doesn't talk. Doffy implies that it's cool even if people find out since their political influence is going to rot away soon anyway.  Meanwhile on Mariejoise, a figure in black walks up some stairs with Luffy's wanted poster, to a frozen room where a huge straw hat sits.

"Not really sure why today of all days, but I decided to write my thoughts on how this game doesn't actually want its players to be teamplayers. I started playing fortnite in september, and ever since the Fortnitemares event all of these event quests have forced players to farm. This leaves one of two options if you do not include farming in private with friends. (we will assume that the only goal people have in their missions is completing these event quests)

- You farm for your missions solo in private

- You farm in public lobbies, leaving the mission itself to whoever is unlucky enough to end up with you in their mission. 

Both of these options are the opposite of team play, and people have been saying this since fortnitemares yet Epic has not changed a thing.

Leaving the event quests aside, Epic does the same in its core game. Whether you contribute or not, whether you are afk at spawn or trapped and defended a whole base, the rewards at the end will be the same. In fact you could argue that farming and leaving everything mission-wise to your teammates is objectively smarter (although undeniably douchy) because you do not spend anything, gain in-game resources and post-game rewards. There is no penalty whatsoever for this behaviour.

Lastly, how this game is built slowly turns the good apples into people that will gladly screw over others that do not perform as they wish. I myself am guilty of this. If I see my teammates are farming and are unresponsive to any of my requests for help I will just activate the mission with tier 1 walls around it and leave or watch it fail. I am not punished for this behaviour either. And even though you could argue that this is justified when no one else wants to contribute, it is still an awful thing to do. 

Epic, you made a teambased game. Please start actively promoting teamplay, rewarding teamplayers and punishing selfish players. Thank you.",43,1527800108.0,8ni6j2,180,Epic rewards selfish behaviour in a teambased game.,https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/8ni6j2/epic_rewards_selfish_behaviour_in_a_teambased_game/,2018-05-31 16:55:08

I got news recently that they were replacing my bumper with a new one \(yay!\).

"As we are approaching the end of One Piece's story, we will start getting major reveals soon.

Most of us grew up following Luffy and his crew along in their adventures and we loved every small detail put into the beautiful world Oda has built.

As the story progressed, a lot of theories and speculations have popped up, out of excitement, hype and anticipation...And now it is almost time to have them actually realized, or debunked.

All i wanted to say is, One Piece has created really high expectations for its major secrets, and no matter what we want or think will happen, it is Oda \(and his editors\) who decides. 

The reveals WILL be polarizing, some people will like them, some people will not. 

I feel sorry already for those who have followed One Piece all throughout the years, only to be disappointed with the ending.. I can't begin to imagine how frustrating that would be. 

So please, don't give in to hype. 

Hype is what kills the beauty in a story like One Piece, don't build up insane expectations only to have them shattered before your eyes, i know it's hard but please try.

Thank you for your attention.",206,1527775147.0,8ng1gn,654,Always remember: Hype IS dangerous.,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/8ng1gn/always_remember_hype_is_dangerous/,2018-05-31 09:59:07

"The gang just hit level 3 and last session my minor villain bandit captain--half orc by the name of Cracked Tusk--dropped something about his ""employer."" They are set to interrogate him for more info, where they'll find out he's an Order Arcane wizard in the next city north. There they'll find he has enslaved a work force of poor modrons, ripping them from the plane of Mechanus, to dramatically increase the city's productivity and deforestation efforts. Now the Great Bear god isn't too happy about this and wants to cull those destroying his woods, but the Stag god and the wood elf nation believe in harmony. Queue up a chaotic struggle between nations and lesser gods full of fuzzy moral choices (the gang has proven to be a hilarious chaotic good group).

What are the wizard's motives? If they survive long enough to free the modrons with the help of B.R.O. Bot 10000 (a comic relief Terminator Warforged) they'll learned the wizard is a masquerading Arcanaloth working as an agent of the Demogorgon, seeding chaos around the realm in various ways (bandits, goblins, starting cold wars, etc). 

Now if they seek out the rumors of strange lights appearing near a ruined tower in the region they'll find a very kind elderly wizard who has been studying demons away from prying eyes. He'll provide information into the nature of the Demogorgon and offer aid/protection in the struggle, saying they can syphon some energy from the great ioun stone keeping the High City aloft, home of the Order Arcane. If the gang is dumb enough to do this they'll drop the High City right onto the Lowtown creating hundreds of thousands of corpses...perfect to raise an army in the name of Orcus. And all before level 10!

Thanks for listening to my rant! Any ideas on how to make this more engaging and sadistic is welcomed.

"A Texan walks into a pub in Galway, Ireland and raises his voice to the crowd of drinkers. He shouts, ""I hear you Irish are a bunch of drinkin' fools. I'll give $500 American dollars to anybody in here who can drink 10 pints of Guinness back to back.""


The room is quiet and no one takes of the Texan's offer.


Paddy Murphy gets up and leaves the bar. Thirty minutes later, he shows back up and taps the Texan on the shoulder.  ""Is your bet still good?"" asks Paddy.


The Texan answers, ""Yes,"" and he orders the barman to line up 10 pints of Guinness.


Immediately, Paddy downs all 10 pints of beer, drinking them all back to back.  The other pub patrons cheer and the Texan sits down in amazement. The Texan gives the Irishman the $500 and asks, ""If ya don't mind me askin', where did you go for that 30 minutes you were gone?""


Paddy Murphy replies, ""Oh... I had to go to the pub down the street to see if I could do it first.""

"I just finished reading the book ""The Making of Star Wars"" by JW Rinzler, a very interesting book wich i recomend to any fan to read.

At the end of the book there is an extract of an interview with Carol Titelman where George Lucas expands the backstory of some characters and other thing of Star Wars wihch was needed for writers to write novelizations, comics, etc.

I found very interesting one section of the explanation of the force. This are George Lucas words in 1977:

*""The Force gives you the power to have extrasensory perception and to be able to see things and hear things, read minds and levitate things. It is said that certain creatures are born with a higher awareness of the Force than humans. Their brains are different;* ***they have more midi\-chlorians in their cells***\*.""\*

Personally i never understood the problem with the midi\-chlorians, never bothered me, but i find pretty ironic that George Lucas got criticized to hell by hardore fans for ""Killing the mistique of the force"" by introducing the midi\-chlorians in TPM when in fact the concept existed since the first movie.

Anyway, i just wanted to share the extract of the interview because i freked out when i saw those words in a 1977 and i thought it was interesting.",54,1527817473.0,8nkfqu,122,George Lucas about The Force and Midi-chlorians in 1977,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/8nkfqu/george_lucas_about_the_force_and_midichlorians_in/,2018-05-31 21:44:33

"I am very serious - the latest Leak has many people feeling hurt, furious, betrayed, and defrauded. If you are a member and haven't decided what you'll do, start putting the money you'd normally tithe into a separate account and just let it sit while you process everything. If, at tithing settlement time, you want to give it to the church, it will be there waiting for you. If you have decided by then that tithing isn't what it was cracked up to be, you will not have donated it for fraudulent reasons (or for reasons you will later regret). 

I resigned toward the end of the year several years ago, but earlier in that year, as my shelf crashed, I realized I needed to back off on tithing. I paid tithing one last month to get a current TR, because some small part of me wanted to believe there was a fragment of truth in the church. It is very conflicting to realize you need to leave the church - you go into denial, and you end up considering the TR as a safety net or something.

I admit I knew when I wrote the check that it would be my last tithe. But even then, I was in denial and waited while I researched and learned more. At the end of the year, I was so very glad I had stopped paying it many months earlier. It saved me thousands of dollars on top of the more than six figures I'd dumped into the cult during my time in the church. 

Just a thought - start putting the money aside until you know what you want to do. ",18,1527811683.0,8njn97,131,On the fence? Withhold your tithing until you decide what you'll do.,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/8njn97/on_the_fence_withhold_your_tithing_until_you/,2018-05-31 20:08:03

"After trading MU, AMD, for a few months I‚Äôve learned a few things that will help me avoid shitty situations like today with the mu downturn. This is not comprehensive and it may be considered basic by many people but I feel like it may be helpful. I‚Äôd love other people‚Äôs learnings to get better at this stuff. Some of it may actually be incorrect so please call it out. 

1. If you buy stock, be willing to hold for months because volatility is unpredictable. The market could spike any time and you need to be willing to hold the stock until it goes up to the price target. This applies to buying the dip as well as buying undervalued stocks. For meme stocks this is even more because most investors are afraid to actually buy until they see a crowd buying and have FOMO

2. Margin and options are risky. Always have an exit and escape plan to ensure you don‚Äôt double or triple down too hard due to greed. Understand the risk and ensure you have downside protection. Insurance for 10-15% less profit is worth it ultimately. 

3. Don‚Äôt try and make quick money. It‚Äôs far better to rely on buying options for far out periods because your liquidity is much higher and you have a lot more time to deal with up and down swings from the volatility. When buying the dip this is pro as hell because now you have ample time to see the stock rise and can optionally sell or exercise whenever you want to ensure you are successful. 

4.  Try and seriously use straddles and spreads sometimes to mitigate downside risk. It‚Äôs more complex and limits upside but is worth it to avoid stress and heartache. 

5. If you YOLO then do it for far out options. And as soon as you start to see serious gains start to roll out your options for further out. If the stock will keep going up, having options a few months ahead won‚Äôt hurt your gains much but it will avoid a scenario where your gains are lost because you held near term options and it suddenly crashed. 

6. Don‚Äôt buy ridiculous options that are too far out of the money or too far in the money just hoping for a huge profit margin. One will potentially be a huge loss and the other will potentially just be dead weight if the stock moves slowly or sideways 

7.  Volatile stocks are great to buy puts and calls on even if you are bullish.  If you see ER profit taking occur then having far out puts that are at a decent strike ITM is worth it in case profit taking makes your stock dip too far. If the stock runs up, just roll it to a higher strike or hold it if it‚Äôs far out. 

This gives downside protection as well as potential profit opportunities for times when the stock will dip guaranteed due to huge run up which is expected. If I did this for Mu I could‚Äôve made a killing and worst case dumped it after inevitable post ER profit taking in case it never dipped. 

8. Pushing your options really far out removes a ton of stress because you have so much time you can literally take weeks away from the market without worrying. This gives more emotional balance and control meaning you‚Äôre less prone to knee jerk reactions like selling your options when it‚Äôs at a huge loss because you aren‚Äôt sure if it‚Äôll be green again while losing time value or if you are worried the profits will go down and you need to take profits immediately. 

9. Don‚Äôt trade on emotions. It is not worth it and you‚Äôll make stupid decisions. Take a day to sit and consider if it‚Äôs a good idea.

10. Options lose value fast and disproportionately to stock. Make sure to keep a good balance of stock and options so you don‚Äôt have your entire portfolio at risk. 

11. Diversify your portfolio of options by dates at the least so it‚Äôs not concentrated to expire at a specific time leaving more exposure to certain events 

12. Remember the market is full of smart people and dumb people. Dumb people follow what the market tells them to do and listen to analysts. Smart people are incentivized to manipulate dumb people to do what they want. Pump and dump and other shit is real. People will not always behave rationally when emotions and money are involved. We‚Äôve seen this a ton with amazing ER and crashing stocks. Don‚Äôt expect rational behavior ever. 

13. Unfortunately analysts and banks have a ton of influence. Noise can obfuscate signal of what stocks are good and people can add and remove that noise for profit. Learn to read between the lines and don‚Äôt take anything at face value. Make sure to read and understand fundamentals before you invest big in something. 

14. If you are long on a stock, buy the fucking dip. It‚Äôll pay off in long run. Stocks with sharp declines will normally bounce back if it‚Äôs not clearly due to fundamentals or missed profits or signs of long term failure. It may take a while though so be prepared to sit. Options far out are a nice way to maintain high exposure with minimal deadweight investment. 

15. It‚Äôs worth it to hold out buying stocks/options at the morning open and end of day close because prices will get better/worse. Prices may rise throughout day to fall at end of day or fall early morning after first hour as profit taking occurs. Same for buying. Use limit prices to space out purchases into smaller orders to get better deals and worst case just change it to buy at market if the direction of stock changes

16. Sell your profits and roll out in thirds. It‚Äôll help mitigate downside risk while giving exposure to upside potential and ensure you are still in game while converting gains. 

17. Price targets are bullshit and more like guidelines. But they do act as catalysts for sheep/dumb people

"Whats boppin r/forhonor, here's the recap for this weeks Warriors Den. We got to hang with Luc, Pope, Damien and our favorite Roman doppelganger, Stefan!

Twitch VOD: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/267747480](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/267747480)

# Weekly content

[Battle outfits](https://youtu.be/KGm0UArtKmo) and Beachhead\-only Dominion event playlist ingame now!

# Review of the last week

The special event has ended. Congrats to the factions for their wins in the community events! Note that those special event weapons/outfits/ornaments are no longer lootable. The weapons they showcased at the S6 reveal stream are still in the game permanently.

# Matchmaking update

With the start of S6, the dev team changed matchmaking parameters and reset everyones matchmaking rating \(MMR, your skill level essentially\). They asked for feedback on this in [\[this thread\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/8mrhg7/matchmaking_feedback_thread/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage). The feedback was, for the most part, negative. Most players seemed to notice long queue times and uneven matchups. Going forward, the matchmaking changes will stay for now. Damien says that since MMR's got reset, queue times and matchups have been exaggerated and will even out as time goes on. They will be keeping an eye on this. LOTS of work in this area is going on and they discussed it multiple times.

They also talked about potentially changing the matchmaking system to never consider rep after players initial few rep gains. Damien spoke about how after your initial reputations, reputation does not at all correlate with skill. Currently, the system considers rep \*and\* skill when matchmaking \(ie. trying to find opponents within a reputation range and within your skill range\).

Activity indicators have also been bugged since S6 \(indicating low activity on most everything\) and have been fixed. Modes haven't actually been this dead.

# E3 Details

Watch the new hero teaser/past\-present\-future video [\[here\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0c0CuV5jT4). They really like the speculation going on about the new character teased! Nothing confirmed/denied, but be excited for For Honor at E3!

# State of Balance: S5

Actual blog post coming later, but see the chart [\[here\]](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/283263768086052864/451786798868201512/unknown.png)

We all know Trump loves to flip the MSM narrative on itself. In this case, he knows they will jump at the chance to drag him and Dinesh through the mud, making it seem as though his crimes were unforgivable.

My view is he's doing this to shine the light on *someone* else who violated campaign finance laws. Whether it's Hillary, who we know was getting shady money all over, or dems running for (re)election this year.

"I've only just discovered this sub so forgive me if this doesn't belong, but I have to tell you guys about my client. First off for some background, I'm an esthetician and my current job is applying eyelash extensions on people. 

Well one day, this woman comes in asking for info and the receptionist walks her through what the extentions are and how they work and all that. I happened to have an opening so they put her on my schedule. While she was filling out her consent forms she's telling us about her jewelery business. Only $5 for any and every piece she sells. I'm thinking hey that's cool I guess she makes and sells it at cultural events or something. Then she gives me her card with a link to her website. I checked it out and it's MLM garbage. Pretty much dismissed her whole sales pitch after that and just did her lashes. She ended up buying something like $200 worth of our retail products after, too, because of course she would. I honestly wasn't even trying to sell her on a lot of those, but she kept asking me about them and putting them in her little basket. 

About a month later she comes back and she's booked with me again because I'm fucking wonderful. She tells me she is leaving because of her ""job"" (read: MLM) and she really needs the extentions to last this time. I let her know we are actually a franchise and if she let's me know where she's going I can look up to see if we have a store in that area. She tells me she doesn't know where she's going. It could be Philly, it could be Boston, it could be Connecticut, it could even be LA...umm...ok...well extentions are each attached to your natural eyelashes and those are falling naturally on the regular so we don't have a way of really stopping that...I asked her how long she's going to be gone. She says ""I don't know. It could be days or weeks or even months...""

So she has a ""Job"" selling crap jewelery for an MLM and they are sending her fuck knows where for fuck knows how long...that's not a job. Thats a cult.",5,1527825459.0,8nlje8,49,My client and her $5 jewelery MLM...,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/8nlje8/my_client_and_her_5_jewelery_mlm/,2018-05-31 23:57:39

"Sacred stones has always been my favorite FE game and the dynamic between the generals of Grado was always one of my favorite parts. Obviously Valter is already in the game which leaves the perfect number remaining. 


Duessel would be a great addition because this game desperately needs a better axe cavalry unit. 

Selena would be a cavalry mage which is a tad bit over saturated right now so she could the TT unit. 

Glen is just a badass and deserves to be in FEH. He would probably be a lance or sword flier and I think he could fill an interesting niche as a tanky flier with solid mixed bulk. 

Caellach is a douche but would still be a fun character to have. Since he‚Äôs the least interesting in my opinion he would probably be the GHB unit. (Also he would be an axe user so that Joshua can kick his ass)

Finally Riev would be the last unit on the banner. I think he would be the most interesting as a staff user focused primarily on dealing damage (maybe have innate wrathful staff on his weapon). Or he could just be a mage since he technically uses tomes in the game. 



Anyway, those are my thoughts on one of my favorite groups of characters in FE and why I think they‚Äôd be fun additions to FEH. 

What are y‚Äôalls thoughts?

"Now this is getting very interesting‚Ä¶

Tommy Robinson, Roseanne, EyeTheSpy, #wherearethe children‚Ä¶

Do you see it?

All this happened in 5 days. And all these ‚Äúheroes‚Äù and issues find their seat in our Movement‚Äôs scope of interest. Coincidence?
No. Not a coincidence. You are witnessing Q‚Äôs opposition gaming up. They have now acknowledged Q‚Äôs tremendous impact and realize they have to come up with more sophisticated weapons on the communication battlefield to shut him down.

Ignoring Q, infiltrating him and labeling him did not work. Infowars and all their recruits are exposed, defeated and Q now has a base, a solid one. A base of woke people transcending races, frontiers, party lines and religions and who are focusing on the real thing: taking down the international pedophile and human trafficking network ran by politicians and billionaires  protecting themselves with nuclear weapons and using the international aid infrastructure to smuggle children, funds and espionage material.

**The cabal is on the run.** 

Follow the pen [Q1424]( https://8ch.net/patriotsfight/res/62.html#93). We are close. The pen is about to take them down. They know it. Trump and Sessions have silently and meticulously done the legal job. The DOJ, FBI and CIA are cleaned up, judges changed, [Red October CEOs resigned]( https://i.imgur.com/WRjMht8.png). Next phase? Open the sealed indictments and start the concert under the direction of the Maestro, with his pen‚Ä¶

So? Put yourself in the enemy‚Äôs shoes for a second. If you were cornered like that, what would you do? You got it. You have to work on people‚Äôs perception and try to win the coming communication battle. You have to blur the message so that people may question Trump‚Äôs motivations, see you as a victim and overlook the horrors you have perpetrated. How do you do that? You create very shiny things and right before the executioner is about to do his job, you go like: 

Hey, stop for a second, did you see this?  
What? 

**Tommy Robinson.** I see you have an interest in human trafficking and, thanks to my divide and conquer strategy and my clownish creations like 9/11, Lynda Sarsour, Sadiq Khan, ISIS and Muslim Brotherhood, you also hate Muslims. So here is a guy who has been arrested for filming an alleged Muslim grooming gang trial‚Ä¶All your required ingredients are in there‚Ä¶ I know right: what is the point about covering a case that at least made it to trial while thousands of pedophile cases around the world are swept under the rug and ignored by law enforcement? Well, I took a chance and hoped people would not see the trick. I made sure MSM was ‚Äúincidentally‚Äù there to capture Tommy‚Äôs arrest and asked Alex Jones to over cover it in the clownish way only he, can pull off [video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc-MC24a0wU). Icing on the cake: to make sure people would really talk about it, I prohibited them to talk about it. How?  By having the judge initiate a temporary reporting ban on Tommy Robinson‚Äôs arrest. Neat right? **Is this shiny enough for you to forget about the children?**

**Roseanne.** You know most of the celebrities in Hollywood are MK Ultra victims and/or Satan worshippers right? You did not? They say it in your face, jokingly. Right here: [video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfkCjYVs0is). So, since they know I can make them rich or bankrupt them overnight, I can activate them directly or through their handlers or drugs, and instruct them to do whatever I want. I know Valerie Jarrett is central in this pedophile and espionage thing. Just like Huma was the Muslim Brotherhood liaison with Clinton, Valerie Jarrett was the MB liaison with Obama. She knows where the bodies are buried and knows how to use it to get things done. [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ChZuXMd.png). She knows about the creation and control of ISIS. She is in the list of the 13 personalities who used a private email address despite national security regulations. [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jomineZ.png) So? Knowing people do not really know Valerie Jarret and that Trump is about to close on her, I instructed Roseanne to go crazy on her and put her on the map. What‚Äôs left in people‚Äôs mind after Roseanne‚Äôs raid? Valerie Jarret is a victim: she was unjustly compared to an ape by a right wing racist. You see the trick? When the real thing about VJ drops, the message is already blurred and can be downgraded to a racial witch hunt. Brilliant.

**EyeTheSpy.** Q has not dropped lately. Even though you have more than you know and have only explored a portion of his board, I know you are now addicted to inside information. Q said no communication outside this board. So? How about some entertainment while Q is silent? I created this guy who went from 47 followers on Twitter to 5000 in 48 hours. Organic? Doesn‚Äôt matter. He knows many things, he‚Äôs cool, interacts with everybody and to make sure you do not create defense mechanisms, he appears to be friendly with Q and to support him. There are topics he is not completely in alignment with Q like Sessions and BC17, but who cares? At least, unlike Corsi, he is not infiltrating and claiming to decode Q, he says he is doing his own thing right? So, you like this? At least when you are reading his easy-to-read tweets, you get your daily insider‚Äôs information fix and are not spending time trying to figure out Q‚Äôs board. I‚Äôll take that‚Ä¶ 

**#WhereAretheChildren.** This is my coolest gadget. I saw that post where Q is giving an update about the dismantlement of the pedophile network and that exchange on Q‚Äôs board between an anon and Q: [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pc6PKmG.png). Most people do not realize the power of these posts. I do. So? I took over the hashtag, made it trend, skillfully dragged Ivanka Trump into the story to spice it up, downgraded the story to a sordid legal issue about the status of unaccompanied child migrants and stuff so that if this hashtag was to come out for the real thing, it would have already been old news and soft news. And of course, to make sure this hashtag is really prematurely dead and of no other relevant use in the future, I had MSM talk about it, talk about it and talk about it. [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sAHQr0m.png). **Is this shiny enough for you to forget about the children?**

So, there you have it‚Ä¶

Folks, I told you in my [previous post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/greatawakening/comments/8mtxth/q1290_autists_need_red_bull_q_what_is_a_true_q/?st=jhuyfmmm&sh=02c07302): don‚Äôt get distracted. Read through the enemy‚Äôs schemes. The closer we get to the epilogue, the more sophisticated his attacks will be. Read through. Stay the course. Are you up to the task? Have you digested Q‚Äôs teachings? Can the children trust you? Yes, they can. I know they can. You would not be reading this otherwise. Stay the course guys. We are about to take them down.

"If I don‚Äôt run double pump or pump and a tac, I know I‚Äôm put at an insane disadvantage in any scenario, and it‚Äôs getting a bit boring at this point.

I don‚Äôt care if you disapprove because you know it‚Äôs the only weapon you use, shotguns need to be overhauled somehow.. 

It‚Äôs not balanced in any sense that shotguns are the #1 weapon used by the entire player-base.

Is not balanced that I can get one pumped even with 100/100 on shields and health.

This game is just draining me of all motivation to play due to this obsession with shotguns.. 

Please just look at your games, look at the first weapons you pick up, look at the weapons 99% of players use when you spectate them.. it‚Äôs all shotguns, every single time.

My account had been compromised and they changed my name, removed all my friends, as well as spent the 2k V-Bucks I had saved up for Rex. I contacted support just 12 hours ago explaining everything and I already got an email saying they had hard reset my password which would force logout anyone on the account and they changed my name back as well as removed the 2 purchased items and refunded my V-Bucks.

They deserve a round of applause thanks Epic!",27,1527825702.0,8nlkmy,85,Epic Support is actually epic now.,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8nlkmy/epic_support_is_actually_epic_now/,2018-06-01 00:01:42

"I had this on r/hiphopheads yesterday, I wanted everyone on hear to see it if you missed it :\) 

 Every album in Kanye West‚Äôs discography has a story attached to it, a narrative or a legend that has emerged since it was released. It‚Äôs tempting to say listeners and critics assign these legacies to Kanye‚Äôs albums as they age, but the raw data tells a different story::**Kanye strategically controls the narrative around every one of his albums, and he begins the process around 60 weeks prior to release date.**I gathered data from Kanye‚Äôs entire discography and back catalogue, including:

* Every song he has ever produced
* Every guest spot he‚Äôs delivered
* Every lead song he‚Äôs released

I analysed the period 60 weeks prior to each album, \(aka when Kanye‚Äôs in ‚ÄúAlbum Mode‚Äù\) to either prove or disprove a commonly held belief for each album. In my research, I found that Kanye is meticulous in his preparation.

## What the Data says about each of Kanye‚Äôs Albums

[***The College Dropout***](https://centralsauce.com/college-dropout-kanye-west)**: Kanye wasn‚Äôt taken seriously or given opportunity as a rapper until his debut album.Prior to** ***The College Dropout:***

* Kanye performed the fewest guest spots
* Kanye delivered the fewest words
* Kanye delivered the fewest hooks
* 77&#37; of Kanye‚Äôs output prior to the album is devoted to production, the most

[***Late Registration***](https://centralsauce.com/late-registration-kanye-west)**: The year Kanye came back to remind everyone he wasn‚Äôt just a great rapper, he was instrumental in crafting the sound of mainstream hip\-hop during the early 2000s.Prior to** ***Late Registration:***

* Kanye released the most beats than prior to any other album
* Kanye produced the most singles of any album cycle
* He gave more beats away \(37\) than any other album
* He produced for 21 separate labels, his most

[***Graduation***](https://centralsauce.com/graduation-kanye-west)**: Kanye transcended rap and became a rock star**

* Ye sold more copies of his promotion singles \(10,000 via ‚ÄúStronger‚Äù and ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Tell Me Nothing‚Äù\) than at any other point in his career
* He went on his longest world tour \(2006\-2008, the most shows he has ever played outside of the U.S. \)
* *Graduation* charted in the top 10 in 14 different countries, a career high \(Yeezus is second with 11\)

[***808s & Heartbreak***](https://centralsauce.com/808s-heartbreak-kanye-west)**: Kanye took the biggest risk of his career on** ***808s***

* Kanye used just 3 samples used on *808s*, making it the least sample\-reliant project of Kanye‚Äôs career \(next lowest is 18 samples on *Yeezus*\)
* Kanye had his lowest output as a producer prior to the album
* 10 tracks that Kanye appeared on or released before the album were R&B, a career high \(*Yeezus* and\* Graduatio\*n each only had 3\)
* The *808s* era is the first time Kanye used auto tune on his lead vocals
* A whopping 88.3&#37; of Kanye‚Äôs vocals on *808*s utilize autotune

[***My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy***](https://centralsauce.com/mbdtf-kanye-west)**: Kanye‚Äôs Ascent to the Top of Mainstream Rap**

* Kanye performed more words and more bars prior to *MBDTF* than any other album
* More Kanye beats were released with Kanye as a guest artist than at any other point in his career
* There isn‚Äôt a a single song prior to *MBDTF* in which Kanye performs only a hook with no rapping
* 6 of Kanye‚Äôs guest spots before the album were Pop, making it his most Pop\-heavy album cycle by far

[***Yeezus***](https://centralsauce.com/yeezus-kanye-west)**: Kanye‚Äôs least accessible album \(the anti\-*****MBDTF*****\)**

* Fewest bars Kanye has ever dropped before an album
* Fewest hooks Kanye has ever delivered \(as lead artist\) before an album \(43 words devoted to hooks\)
* Kanye produced the fewest tracks for guest artists ever prior to *Yeezus*
* He produced for just 4 different artists, and 6 separate labels, his lowest

[***The Life of Pablo***](https://centralsauce.com/life-of-pablo-kanye-west)**: Kanye‚Äôs most confusing album**The legacy of *TLOP* is yet to be felt, but the data has a hard time figuring outwhat that feeling will look like.

* 44 samples were used on the album, the most for any Kanye album
* The album is mid\-range when considering stats like bars prior to album \(3rd\), 31 tracks produced \(4th\), Singles produced \(3rd\), Kanye not rapping on his own beats \(5th\)
* Kanye released more album tracks prior to *TLOP*
* Ye produced more pop songs \(6\) prior
* \*TLOP‚Äô\*s singles performed the worst on the Hot 100 than any other Ye release

**Kanye‚Äôs 2018 Album: What do the numbers say?**The follow up to *The Life of Pablo* is due to drop this Friday, and Kanye‚Äôs stats in the past 60 weeks don‚Äôt give a lot of clues as to the content or sound. He‚Äôs produced 9 tracks for other artists, and 2 for himself. He has dropped 2 loosies, ‚ÄúLift Yourself‚Äù and ‚ÄúYe Vs. The People‚Äù. He featured on Travis Scott‚Äôs ‚ÄúWatch‚Äù, which hit 16 on the Hot 100, his next best was 48 with his production credit on ‚ÄúBBO‚Äù by Migos.No Kanye rollout has tracked a similar path. With the promise of 7 songs, and the above statistics, it seems this project could be an odd mix between *Yeezus* and *808s*. Both projects found Kanye withdrawn and reserved \(musically\) prior to their release.One thing is for certain: it will make sense 10\-15 years from now.If you‚Äôre interested in getting a little deeper into the analysis, you can find my [full write ups w/ complete data on each of Kanye‚Äôs albums here](https://centralsauce.com/tag/yeezy-season).

"There was nothing quite like watching a whole field of people gather and prepare for war, and then converge on that single big circle, and watch an entire battlefield erupt in the chaos of Warfare.

20v20 is ok, but it just doesn't have the same feeling of choas and war that 50v50 V2 does.

2 buses, 2 sides, 1 big nearly endless fight that feels like a war.

It was so awesome, and 20v doesn't capture that feel. 


20v20v20v20v20 feels more like, what you'd do for a qualifiers for a Ranked tournament pre LAN. Where you seed teams and then run matches to get the qualifiers.

50v50V2 feels far more blessed in the chaos of war, and yet it was relaxing and fun and carefree too.

"Skins you can only unlock via challenges would be so cool!
-Revive skin, revive 1,000 players
-Kill skin, kill 5,000 players 
-Material collecting skin, collect 100,000 materials (Could also have separate skins for separate materials)
-Chest searching skin, search 500 chests 

Of course all the numbers are subject to change and they were just random estimates to what I thought they would be.

There is endless possibilities and it reminds me of level 99 skill capes in Runescape which were super hard to get and I believe it should be similarly hard to get in fortnite.

This is a link to the post that gave me the idea and they made a creative edit of a revive skin so check that out too: https://reddit.app.link/nKjjV6PknN

Thanks everyone, let me know what you think of this idea!


TLDR; Skins you could unlock based on doing things such as killing, reviving, collecting material, etc. 

Edit: Back Blings might be a good idea but I worry that‚Äôs too close to the capes and might cause some kinda of lawsuit. ",10,1527825335.0,8nlisz,63,Unlock-able Skins,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8nlisz/unlockable_skins/,2018-05-31 23:55:35
