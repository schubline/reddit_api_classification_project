"I am 18 y/o, female. I am not an athlete, but I love running and badminton . I am moderately active & started regular training when I was 15 (i mean exercising and such). 

January (i think) was a physically intensive month. I had a 5k marathon, a fitness midterm, p.e final, and the track and field event. I was eating healthy and focusing on eating the right things and staying hydrated and nurtured. I always stretched before exercising. I thought I nailed it all.

All of a sudden my tibia was hurting sooooo much. Every time I ran or jumped the pain increased, when I settled it toned down. I could swear I feel the pain in the bone. Right in the middle of the bone and spreading in painful strokes. 


The pain started in the fitness midterm: I was supposed to jump 80 times in two minutes or something— which okay is easy I get it. Anyway I only did 40 and fell, the teacher said I can redo but I was in so much pain I refused. After the track and field event, I fell in pain after running, but so did my friend so I thought it was okay. She was in much greater pain that she cried and couldn’t move, so I shrugged my pain off. In the final p.e. I only did 20 and fell crying (wow so much falling in one story). It was then when I consulted a physician.

She said it was a severe muscle cramp that it felt like the bone hurts. She said I should rest it for 6 weeks with hot repetitive fomenting (?).

Anyhow, I obviously did and the pain no longer affects my daily activities. But I am trying to get back to running but I freak out whenever my bone start hurting (idk if that’s a normal pain it just feels like it is going to be back so I stop). Any suggestions? Anyone with a similar case? Is it really a cramp? If yes how can I avoid it? 


Tl;dr: My tibia hurts badly when I run. Any reasons why?

"I'm a Brit who has recently decided to get into US sports (couldn't care less for soccer and the Premier League so figured this is a great alternative) and so have decided to follow teams from various sports.

Bear in mind that I worked at a summer camp in Maryland state and so I will support the teams that my American friends support however I have chosen another team from either another league or that is West to try and get a different flavour while I get settled into the games and understand more about the sports (tactics, team play, individual players,etc.) I have been using various articles and Reddit discussions in order to decide who I will support. I'm going to stick with these teams for a season and then regroup and make a final choice in case I'm entertained more by another team.
