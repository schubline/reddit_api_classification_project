Let me know if you have any questions! ",0,"Hi everyone! 

360Giving is running a data visualisation competition open for everyone. We are inviting you to use our dataset to visualise innovative solutions to two questions facing the grantmaking sector: 1. Who has funded what themes throughout the years? 2. User\-led organisations: Who funds them, in what thematic area, how much funding do they receive and what type of organisation are they? 

Entries must use the 360Giving dataset to answer one of the questions and you are encouraged to use other datasets alongside it. You can find a list of suggested datasets [here](https://challenge.threesixtygiving.org/resources). The prizes of between £2,000 and £6,000 will be awarded to the best three responses to the questions. In addition, each entry that meets our submission criteria will receive an award of between £100 and £500 \(depending on the number of submissions and their quality\).

"I am looking for software to design plots and export them to image/pdf/etc. Something like Plotly's online Graph Maker, but faster, more feature rich, more chart types, and ideally not web-based.

I typically design plots using MatPlotLib in Python and manipulate data with pandas/numpy. But, ever since I started using PowerBI at work, I've been hunting for something similar. I must say that I like the ability to quickly switch through different chart types to see what works best. However, I don't like PowerBI because it relies on power query, hides too much functionality (for styling plots), and doesn't support exporting charts to image (seriously...?).

I haven't tried Tableau, but the $70/month license seems a bit too steep for me. Especially for what I want to do with it.

"I'm looking for a tool that will allow me to create something like this:

http://tbtest3.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

All I had to do was install an Excel add-on, then create a spreadsheet with an image on each row and its metadata in the columns. The add-on generated all the code and files necessary to view in a special PivotViewer browser (based on Silverlight).

The idea behind Pivot was that many versions of one image were created at various levels of granularity. Depending on the level of zoom, the PivotViewer would stitch together the necessary files. This way, the browser doesn't spend time loading every single image at full resolution; it loads what it needs to only when the user zooms in on an image.

Microsoft Live Labs shut down in 2010 so they've removed the Excel add-on. Another company created a [cross-browser version of PivotViewer](https://github.com/openlink/html5pivotviewer), which I used to create the visualization above, but they stopped actively developing it in 2014. If you play around with the viz above, you'll run into some bugs that I imagine will never be fixed.

I don't know JavaScript well enough to fix the bugs myself, so I was wondering if there are other tools out there where:

* I can show hundreds images at a time without the user having to wait for full-size images to load

* The user can easily filter by metadata

* Isn't buggy

* I can figure out how to use it. I have decent Python skills, so I'm not completely opposed to having to program.

I've looked a little into D3 and Tableau, but it wasn't clear that I could represent each data point as an image and that the user wouldn't have to wait for 100MB of image data to download before being able to interact with the data.

"I'm not sure if this is the best place for a question like this, but I figure this fits under ""information visualization"".

I am a software engineer, and I often find myself wanting to get dependency graphs in a visual form, as opposed to just in my head. I realize there are several tools that can generate good looking graphical DAGs (and I've used several of them before), but even if the tool just generates simple images, these are not nearly as portable or simple to create as plain text. Considering these graphs are always just for personal use, I'd really just like a clear way to represent graphs in plain, monospace text.

My first approach is always to list all of the nodes, and add a sub-list under each node for the list of nodes connected to the parent by an edge *starting at* the parent.

For example, for a simple three-node graph with edges going from A -> B -> C -> A:

    A:
    - B
    B:
    - C
    C:
    - A

However, this format doesn't scale very well. I feel like there is a ""standard"" way to represent graphs, particularly one that might be able to take advantage of two dimensions rather than one.

I apologize if this sounds stupid, but it's really just a curiosity more than anything. I prefer to take notes on my laptop in a simple plain text editor, so this would be a huge help.

Some context: I recently started a career as the Head of Data Management/Research at a luxury real estate company, and despite not working with data in any professional capacity before this, I am a quick learner and quite good with anything tech related.

Ideally, this would be a “live” kind of thing, so if I were to, say, add a new contact into the database, I could put them into different tags or categories, like the town they live in or net worth, etc and see those results changed automatically.

Thank you so much in advance. ",0,"Apologies if this post is not being made in the right sub, but I am having a hard time figuring out where exactly to begin on my data viz journey.

Some context: I recently started a career as the Head of Data Management/Research at a luxury real estate company, and despite not working with data in any professional capacity before this, I am a quick learner and quite good with anything tech related. 

The big project my employers are expecting from me is to turn their current data platform (a shared Dropbox folder with tons of vital customer, property, and marketing info) and create (or, find one that already exists) a cloud-based platform that multiple users can access to store and manage these data segments. Ideally, this would be a “live” kind of thing, so if I were to, say, add a new contact into the database, I could put them into different tags or categories, like the town they live in or net worth, etc and see those results changed automatically.

The main goal of this is to make it easy to automate (or, easily) create powerful visualizations for meetings and presentations, as well as have a new and organized home for our data.

"I am digging into the performance of a piece of code. The data I gather varies along quite a few dimensions, so a simple table does not give much of an insight and likely obscurs interesting patterns that may be present in the raw numbers.

* I have an algorithm that I can encode in 3 slightly different ways. (Let's call them *variants*.)
* I can then compile each variant with 3 different modes of optimization.
* I can compile with or without a ""*profiling*"" option that is desirable but may sometimes influence performance, and I'd like to know if it does.
* I can use either of 4 different compiler versions.

So, I must compare a total of 72 program runs.

For each run, I gather running time and memory footprint, but since there are a handful slightly different ways to do this (for example, the report generated by the program itself versus the external measurements done by the operating system), there may be 2 or even 3 competing data points for time and the same for memory footprint. There may be other, more particular data points that I may want to add to the picture in the future, such as the runs of garbage collection, the proportion of time spent in user / kernel mode, and so on.

I must decide what data points I want, judging by their apparent importance, so I am probably best off with first reviewing the whole collection, and then collapsing or dropping some data points. What I need in the end is some kind of an insightful report that helps to notice trends, such as ""compilers of version 1 and 2 produce a steeply faster executable than those of version 3 and 4, but only with profiling off"".

When I only had to compare 2 or even 6 different runs, I just tabulated the data via command line. But 72 runs with multiple data points for each seems to be too much for a human to grasp in raw numbers.

I am zero in data science so I will appreciate any advice. Corrections (to terminlogy I use or my general understanding of the question) are welcome as well.

"I've been doing a lot of data analysis in JavaScript. It makes sense for me to work in JavaScript, because I already use it and that's where my visualizations normally end up. JavaScript has a very rich ecosystem of visualization libraries so that's not surprising. All these visualization libraries are browser based... which is great if that's where you want your visualization to be. It's not so great if you just want to render a chart to an image, say to store for later or to include in some kind of report.

I wanted to be able to render charts from the command line. I wanted to be able to render charts from a headless server. There seems to be no charting or plotting library for JavaScript that supports this directly. We can however approach this indirectly and in my new blog post I'll show you how to render charts from Node.js. It's not as easy or convenient as we'd like but it is possible using a browser visualization library coupled with a headless browser.

What method(s) can I use to gracefully handle this, without being *too* computationally expensive, while still showing a curve that best describes the data?

Ideas I've come up with so far include:

* A single value is computed for each pixel, corresponding to the mean or mode of the samples encapsulated by that pixel.
* As above, but don't do aggregation per pixel - rather interpolate the original curve, and pick the interpolated value corresponding to the pixel mapped to the original domain.

I recently began using the Magic Music Visuals program for a live VJ project that I have been doing for a couple of years.  I would like to set up some cameras to incorporate live video of the band being projected behind them.  Does anyone have any experience with this program?  I am currently attempting to test out the live video with my iphone camera but can't seem to figure out the best way to stream my video to my computer.  I downloaded PocketCam lite as a trial.  This seems to work but is only in black and white.  I know the paid version lets you use color in your videos but I don't want to buy it until I've decided it is the best program for my use.  Eventually I would like to get some cameras to use and can figure out ways to stream those to my computer but want to mess around with my phone first.  Any help here would be amazing as I am just beginning to use this program and have not streamed live videos over any of this yet.

"As a side project the director of my agency wants me to look into some ways to visualize and interpret data around geolocations. Our agency has multiple campuses across the region, a few hours apart, and finding a point in between to have the occasional all staff gathering can be a pain, because every grouping complains that they have to drive more. 

I've uploaded everyone's addresses in an excel sheet and found a few geomapping tools, like [BatchGeo](https://batchgeo.com/) that help visualize groupings and map all the points. What the director really wanted was some insight on how much people are driving to our current all staff meeting points and BatchGeo doesn't do any batch calculating.

After a lot of searching, I found this [great blog post](https://tableauandbehold.com/2015/09/22/extremely-fast-geocoder-and-driving-distance-finder/) with a tableau map pack that helps me calculate driving time and distance between several map points and a single map point. I've uploaded that data for every one of the 9 all-staff locations into a sheet on excel and calculated average driving time and the standard deviation for each location. With this information, we can at least pinpoint which locations have the lowest average driving time for company members, taking variation into consideration.

Very similar idea but I wanted to have a play with the different features and generally just get stuck in.

- I got my data by simply copy + paste individual players on the ATP website (if bigger dataset I'd work with excel's external data source)

"So I've started a new series called ""By The Numbers"", where I take a statistical look at certain hip-hop topics. I've tackled ageism in hip-hop, how many times Lil Wayne says ""Pussy"", and how often popular rappers mention themselves.

My graph game is woeful though. I really do need to sort out how I am going to visualize my data, because it's really really holding me back. 

[Here](http://www.bensbigblog.com.au/2017/08/by-numbers-ageism-in-hip-hop-doesnt_28.html) is my ageism article, and [this](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-70NQbMm-RHI/WZ9lNMM1rMI/AAAAAAAAE4Q/W0ESXtb4tEI2vCTzXph7BIcPMJtFsjFzwCLcBGAs/s1600/black%2Bavg%2Bdependent.PNG) was my big finish, the graph that held the key data. It's not good. 

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/FbWKT) is my current project. I am trying to statistically represent the peak and death of New York hip-hop. This graph needs too much explanation. How can I go about putting everything I need on the one infographic? 

What can I use? Is there anything you recommend? Do I need to get my hands dirty and just use MS Paint? I am not monetized, so I can't really spend a lot of money on this.

"I'm sorry everyone, I hate these posts but I'm turning up nothing with google.

I want essentially a [force directed graph](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045), but without edges and to illustrate time series group membership/movement. 

I have a cohort I want to illustrate how they move through membership in roughly 10 different groups across a set of roughly 60 periods. I'd like each individual to be represented as a node which has a velocity applied when membership changes and nodes collide to give a ""fluidity"" to their movement.  And group ""centers"" are spread apart to show the clustering.

I know this exists, I've seen a few d3 implementations before, but right now I can't figure out what to google to get me back to those examples.

"Hi all,

I'm trying to develop an icon for an infographic, very much like the image in this [Stack Overflow request](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12458476/how-to-create-circular-progress-barpie-chart-like-indicator-android) but with rounded (mitre) edges on the green bar. It's important for the size of the green bar to be an accurate representation of the percentage inside the circle, which is what I'm struggling with.

I unfortunately don't have access to advanced design software, but do have Inkscape and Gimp. I've been trying to code it in R, but the pipeline is very clunky and the result isn't particularly attractive. I also tried Canva's standard elements, but it only supports very basic cosmetic customisation.

"Basic info is in the title. I use a laptop for college work, but it's not always in use, so I thought it would be interesting to record my battery percentage over time. I have 38,419 data points spanning from late August of 2016 to mid April of 2017 in CSV format, which includes a full formatted date, Unix time (for easier number processing), and the percentage as a number 0-100.

The script only runs when the laptop is powered on and active, so any time where the time jumps by more than 2 minutes is a period where the laptop was inactive. This also allows for sharp vertical spikes, I often powered the laptop off for the night when charging it. I also recorded similar data for battery health as a percentage, but that isn't shown here and there's much less data anyways, since that script only measured it once every day.

What are some tools I could use to process this kind of information? LibreOffice Calc (basically Excel) lags out when I try to graph 38K data points, and that's not exactly the kind of visualization I'm looking for anyways. These are some of the ideas I had for visualizations, but I'm not sure how to go about making them:

* Battery health in relation to usage, I'd love to see how battery health relates to charge cycles

* Heatmap for usage shown on an hourly resolution on a one-week chart. My school has 4 7-week terms per year, I'd like to see how usage varies across each term since I never had any kind of concrete study/work schedule.

* Time charging vs. discharging -- how much work did I do on my laptop when charging vs. discharging? I often brought my charger to planned group meetings, but not to classes, so this information could be interesting (especially if visualized in another heatmap-style graph)

* Whole-year usage heatmap, day resolution. That is, show a year calendar with different colors for each day based on how much the laptop was used.

"It's relatively easy to create a rolling average trend line for data where the data points are consistently distributed on the x-axis. For example, if you'd measured your weight every single day, you could take the average of the last 7 data points to plot a rolling 7-day average.

How might you create a similar trend plot for data where the data points are *not* equally spaced on the x-axis? For example, if you weighed yourself infrequently – sometimes multiple times a day, sometimes with several days in between – how would you create a trend that isn't over-weighted (excuse the pun) for the days with multiple measurements?

Another example that comes to mind is fivethirtyeight.com's presidential approval visualization: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/ Sometimes there are multiple polls on a single day, sometimes they are days apart.

Thanks!",0,"It's relatively easy to create a rolling average trend line for data where the data points are consistently distributed on the x-axis. For example, if you'd measured your weight every single day, you could take the average of the last 7 data points to plot a rolling 7-day average.

How might you create a similar trend plot for data where the data points are *not* equally spaced on the x-axis? For example, if you weighed yourself infrequently – sometimes multiple times a day, sometimes with several days in between – how would you create a trend that isn't over-weighted (excuse the pun) for the days with multiple measurements?

I've been using Google maps API until now, where I don't think I can accomplish this except with fusion tables maybe, which seems like it will require me to draw hundreds of polygons for regions of the world. I could be wrong on this, and am researching that in the meantime.

When the calculation gets more complex, this form could help you to understand the structure better, and show all the intermediate results if you want. Also, this calculator is fully interactive in that everything is draggable and selectable, so making changes to a multi-step calculation is a lot easier as well. Hope you like it. Thanks!

Also, this calculator is fully interactive in that everything is draggable and selectable, so making changes to a multi-step calculation is a lot easier as well. Hope you like it. Thanks!

"Hi all,

I'm wondering would anyone out there have experience with Spotfire and Qlik Sense? I come from a Qlik Sense background myself. My boss is asking me to come up with a comparison of Qlik vs Spotfire. Most of the analysis I can find is 2-3 years old at this stage. I know Qlik has come on leaps and bounds in that time, I can only assume Spotfire is the same. 



From a bit of research I have figured:


Spotfire is still superior for modeling and analytics


Qlik seems visually more appealing.


Interaction - are they roughly equivalent? 


Incremental reloads - Spotfire's ETL doesn't seem fantastic. Is there such a thing as incremental reloads in Spotfire? seems like you load everything fresh?


Speed - I couldn't get much info on spotfire. Can it handle big data and allow speedy interactions?


Qlik has a huge library of APIs, so I think it wins out for customization. 


Search/selections - all fields in Qlik are selectable and will filter your data accordingly. From any Spotfire demos I could find, that doesn't seem to be the case?

Basically Im in the process of putting together a rough plan for some much needed networking plans. I have all the data I need; current and upgrade items/cost/roi over time as well as detailed breakdowns of each services total cost.

Im just completely lost as how to visualize this in a comprehensive way. How to organize my excel sheets - Do I just go with tons of column/rows for every little thing? Do I make seperate pages for each service? How do I compare everything overall?

"In the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (BotW), there are 120 shrines spread across a game world that people can complete in any order. Similarly, there are 4 main dungeons in the game that people can complete in any order. To generalize, lets just say I have k tasks that can be completed in any order by people.

My question is what's the most interesting way to visualize/plot this information to perhaps show trends in the data, etc.. This might be different for the cases when k=4 and k=120.

"So I've always wanted to make visualizations that combine precise, sharply drawn mathematical concepts (ellipses, graphs, integrals) and high resolution images of nature.  Basically, showing all the math that goes on in nature.  

I know I'll eventually use Photoshop to layer the different images together, but I was wondering what other software people have found that combines mathematical/tables/rigid geometry concepts and high resolution images.  

The graphs I get out of Mathematica, for example, are always pixelated at the size I want to see them at, i.e, on a full color poster at 600 dpi.  

If you want to get an idea of what I'm trying to make, think of a line graph showing how the surface area of a mammal scales versus the volume of the mammal, superimposed over a high res image of a rabbit and an elephant.

"**Background:**

Our workgroup has regular meetings and I noticed a pattern on how people seat - roundish table - which appears to be a mix of sub-field and hierarchy.

**The data:**

For several weeks I noted who sitted where starting at the head of the group. I can now calculate pair frequencies, etc, very easily. Not everybody is always present (except the leader). 
Categorical data would be job title and field of study.

**The goal:**

This is a bit of fun, and I planning on anonymizing the data,  but I wanted to show that some people tend to sit closer to each other and form clusters. We are having a social gathering in a few months time and this would be a ""surprise"". We are weird like that.

**Visualization:**

This is where you come in. I am a bit out ideas. I could some some network style analysis with edge thickness representing pairs, or even clusters. another alternative would be a [circos plot](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8RBwy.png) linking people but what? How close they are on average, or how frequently they connect? A [Sankey plot](https://ouseful.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/oli_hawkins__internal_migration_flows_in_the_uk.png?w=768&h=576)? Any other ideas?

**Tools:**

I do mostly R/python but open to other languages. 

Cheers.

"Suppose I have a growing time series, the number of outages at a utility (service locations without service).  The series is sampled hourly with a summary presented to executives.

The most important thing is the total number of outages.  There are two other components, though: outages added in the last hour and outages restored in the last hour.

We assume the executives have a few primary questions:

* How many people are out right now?
* Is it getting better or worse?
* What is changing in the background?  (Hence the outages added and restored.  Are we holding our own, but there is a lot of activity?  Or are we holding our own and nothing much has changed?)

"Hi!

I have a strange data set that I am struggling to visualise and I was wondering if anyone here had any insight?

It's ""UFC"" (mixed martial arts) fighter rankings, specifically ones that I've generated via an algorithm...

I have the ""top 100"" fighters (realistically it can be any number between 2-100 fighters at a time) and I have this data ""Per month"" over about 
between 6 and 12 years depending on which specific data set I use 

Currently my graphs are looking like this: 

http://i.imgur.com/zP11VGw.png

Which is obviously horrible, but I'm not sure of a way to do this better. It doesn't even have to be a graph, I'm open to literally any form of visualisation!

I have unlimited space, unlimited time to learn (although if it is possible in HighCharts rather than D3 that would be preferable) 

Looking forward to some advice!

"Hello,
I hope it is alright to ask this question here as it's probably very rudimentary but data visualization isn't my forte.
I essentially did a survey and got some results on a product some people use with about 150 rows/replies.
The data is mostly on a 1-10 scale among some boolean yes/no questions.
I've tried to make stuff with excel, but it isn't turning out the way I'd like. Would anyone with some imagination suggest something, or does anyone know of some more intuitive tools I could use?

"Hey, people

I need some insight on tools to realize a visualization for school and hope you can give me some help. 

We need to create a visualization starting with data from an in-class poll. Anyway, my idea is to do it like a network, where people would be closer depending on their hobbies and interests, while other categories would give extra information regarding skills and aptitudes. Basically, my idea is this:

Position/X-Y axis: personal hobbies
Size: overall skills (a score from 0/90)
Color: best skill (self-manifested).

So, I already categorized the data, turning the open question about hobbies into a few categories, and have also overall skill scores. 

I tried to do this with Gephi. What I got is a network where people are linked to central nodes that represent the categories. It kind of works, but I am having a problem changing the dimensions, like adding overall skill column and make it the size. 

Is Gephi the right tool for it? How can I change node size and make it independent from links? 
If not Gephi, what other tool can you recommend me? I would try 3D.js, but I can't program and have no time to learn it from scratch.

"Hello there! I have absolutely no background in data analysis or programming or anything remotely helpful for what I am now trying to do. So I appreciate your time and your patience if you're able. I've spent the last couple hours googling and reading, and I feel like I am getting close to what I need, but not quite there...


I work for a nonprofit who hosts a very large festival every May. What I'm trying to do is generate a US map showing where the festival attendees are coming from. So the more attendees come from an area, the darker it would be shaded. I'd love to do this by zip code but by state would be okay, too.


So I have at least figured out that this is called a *choropleth map* and I found a couple tutorials for making them using data in excel. That's what I have access to: a big excel spreadsheet generated by our online event registration software. The spreadsheet basically gives a list from Registrant #1 down through Registrant #X and for each registrant it tells what zip code they are from.


Here's my stumbling block, though -- all of the tutorials I've found are asking for counts (values) that correspond with each zip code, NOT just a list of zip codes (with many of the zip codes repeated multiple times in the list). In other words, *this is what I have*:

- 43606

- 43606

- 43620

- 43619

- 43606

- 43620


But *this is what I need*:

- 43606 : 3

- 43619 : 1

- 43620 : 2


Wish I could do this by hand, but I expect to have between 1500-2000 registrants when all is said and done. 


I hope that makes sense -- it's hard to articulate. But can anyone give me some pointers or help on how to get from what I have to what I need? Thanks for your time.

To help you, here is the issue;

Universities here restrict Graduate Students from working more than 10 hours a week on-campus to prevent them from falling behind in the completion of their degree. Now this policy affects *every* student, but really it targets a very specific student, a student which; A) Works more than 10 hours a week, B) Falls behind in their studies, and C) Falls behind in their studies specifically because of their work load.

I need to visualize this, I think it has to kind of be one graphic on top of another graphic, like a big wide circle (for the policy) and smaller and smaller circles within that big circle. However, that feels kind of simple and lame.

i'm using paraview as a visualization tool for a DEM-analysis. My DEM result files are written in VTK format and read perfectly by paraview. However, at a certain amount of particles (in my case 40.000) paraview becomes extremely slow.   
The particles are displayed with spherical glyphs. Saving an animation takes almost as long as the DEM-analysis. The VTK-files certainly aren't small, one being 12 mb, but it's just unbearable.     
  
I've noticed that paraview won't utilize more than 1 core at a time. I've compiled it from source, enabeling MPI and also set AUTO MPI in the paraview settings, What am i missing?

"I'm seeking some help with a visualization I need done by the end of Christmas week (12/28).  I'm using Tableu, but am willing to use something else if I don't need to purchase it.  (I have SPSS, MySystat, Excel.)  

In speech, each sound/phoneme has a range of frequencies that when added together become the speech sound.  These are called formants (giving background so you get the concept).  For the /er/ sound, there are 5 of these ranges: F0-100-250, F1-400-600, F2-1300-1800, F3-1700-2200, F4-3300-3800.  This should be my X axis, with the Z axis being the color of ""F0-5.""  My Y axis needs to be intensity, in this case (-0.70) is my intensity level.  

I have 44 of these sets that I'm trying to graph.  My problem really comes with the X axis.  I can't figure out how to get the data in to get it looking like what I want.

A small preview of the dataset can be seen here: [click here](https://gyazo.com/14221bf523b18eaa93259e2ae7e5aa37)

The dataset contains testing results for speech recognition systems. I'd like to compare those systems to each other. By looking at the accuracy rate, and the time. 
As of the current possibilities, the column:

 * name contains 5 unique values

 * mic contains 2 unique values

 * environmental sounds contains 2 unique values

 * system contains 3 unique values

 * sentence is a range from 1 to 8 for each user, mic, system combination. Each sentence has 10 result rows, containing the time and accuracy.


Now my question, what is the best way to plot this? I'd like to see differences in accuracy and time depending on mic, system and environmental sound used. 

I actually plotted the data using a line graph containing the average values for each sentence, per user per system. But that gives me 15 graphs, which is too much to display in a report. [example plot 1](https://gyazo.com/604d9dc04333d24dcfa9831ff9ee412e) and a bar graph containg the averages for each user [example plot 2](https://gyazo.com/3a435069ffcbbb223518e54a552f71b0), however this gives me either 20 plots if I take the average for all systems, or 60 plots if I split it up. 
I've been thinking about a scatterplot, but i can't seem to find a way to reduce the amount of graphs to let's say, 2x A4 size. 

I found another plotting tool, which I used to make this: [image](https://gyazo.com/f677c82f71d278a3b9a5a4fc609b5ad0)
I grouped everything on system, environment and microphone. But I can't say it's really clear. (I see that there's an error in the image in the Legend. empty stands for 'Environmental Sound?')",0,1479245380.0,5d2hw8,False,"Hi,

"I would like to visualise a large amount of data (500,000 data points). Typically, I visualise these as heat maps since this enables me to analyse the data in 3D.

Thus, what tools do you use for high-performance visualisation? Specifically, what tools are there that allows the user to explore the data interactively?

"Hi, everyone. I'm a final year student in computer science. I'm having problem/explanation related to data visualization in my final year project.

Basically, my project is for calculating the cost of producing a product in business Food & Beverages.

What the app does is user input how many units they want to produce the product ( e.g: 100 burgers ) and let the user input all the cost (material cost, indirect labor, production cost and etc ) and comes up with the final cost of producing the product ( e.g: $50 to produce 100 burgers).


I have accounting lecturer as my co-supervisor to help me with the accounting formula. It's not a big deal. Since I'm a computer science student, my lecturer wants me to include a complexity in my project and I want to add data visualization technique ( I want to try new things).
Any idea what data/information can I present by doing data visualization?
Since data visualization is dealing with a ton of data and interpret new information from it. 


My project based on Android Application.

What the app does is user input how many units they want to produce the product ( e.g: 100 burgers ) and let the user input all the cost (material cost, indirect labor, production cost and etc ) and comes up with the final cost of producing the product ( e.g: $50 to produce 100 burgers).


I have accounting lecturer as my co-supervisor to help me with the accounting formula. It's not a big deal. Since I'm a computer science student, my lecturer wants me to include a complexity in my project and I want to add data visualization technique ( I want to try new things).
Any idea what data/information can I present by doing data visualization?
Since data visualization is dealing with a ton of data and interpret new information from it.
