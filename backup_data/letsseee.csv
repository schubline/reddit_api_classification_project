"Ellen Pao resigned from reddit today by mutual agreement.  I'm delighted to announce that Steve Huffman, founder and the original reddit CEO, is returning as CEO.
 
We are thankful for Ellen’s many contributions to reddit and the technology industry generally.  She brought focus to chaos, recruited a world-class team of executives, and drove growth.  She brought a face to reddit that changed perceptions, and is a pioneer for women in the tech industry.  She will remain as an advisor to the board through the end of 2015.  I look forward to seeing the great things she does beyond that.
 
We’re very happy to have Steve back.  Product and community are the two legs of reddit, and the board was very focused on finding a candidate who excels at both (truthfully, community is harder), which Steve does.  He has the added bonus of being a founder with ten years of reddit history in his head.  Steve is rejoining Alexis, who will work alongside Steve with the new title of “cofounder”.
 
A few other points.  Mods, you are what makes reddit great.  The reddit team, now with Steve, wants to do more for you.  You deserve better moderation tools and better communication from the admins.
 
Second, redditors, you deserve clarity about what the content policy of reddit is going to be.  The team will create guidelines to both preserve the integrity of reddit and to maintain reddit as the place where the most open and honest conversations with the entire world can happen.

Third, as a redditor, I’m particularly happy that Steve is so passionate about mobile.  I’m very excited to use reddit more on my phone.
 
As a closing note, it was sickening to see some of the things redditors wrote about Ellen. [1] The reduction in compassion that happens when we’re all behind computer screens is not good for the world.  People are still people even if there is Internet between you.

If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.  Steve’s great challenge as CEO [2] will be continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward.
 
 
[1] Disagreements are fine.  Death threats are not, are not covered under free speech, and will continue to get offending users banned.

Ellen asked me to point out that the sweeping majority of redditors didn’t do this, and many were incredibly supportive. Although the incredible power of the Internet is the amplification of voices, unfortunately sometimes those voices are hateful.
 
[2] We were planning to run a CEO search here and talked about how Steve (who we assumed was unavailable) was the benchmark candidate—he has exactly the combination of talent and vision we were looking for.  To our delight, it turned out our hypothetical benchmark candidate is the one actually taking the job.


NOTE: I am going to let the reddit team answer questions here, and go do an AMA myself now.

"Hello Reddit,

I’m just a normal guy, who spends his free time with his hot wife and cat in St. Louis. I didn’t see any of this coming, it’s been a crazy week. I want to make something good come out of this moment, so I’m donating a portion of the proceeds from my Represent T-Shirt campaign to the St. Patrick Center raising money to fight homelessness in St. Louis.

I’m an open book doing this AMA at my desk at work and excited to answer America’s question.

Please support the campaign and the fight on homelessness! [Represent.com/bonezone](https://represent.com/bonezone/)

Proof: http://i.imgur.com/GdMsMZ9.jpg

Edit: signing off now, just like my whole experience so far this has been overwhelmingly positive!  Special thanks to my Reddit brethren for sticking up for me when the few negative people attack.  Let's just show that we're better than that by not answering hate with hate.  Maybe do this again in a few weeks when the ride is over if you have questions about returning to normal.

My client will be answering no further questions.

NEW EDIT:  This post is about to be locked, but questions are still coming in.  I made a new AMA to keep this going.  [You can find it here!](https://redd.it/63posi)

"After two weeks abroad, I was looking forward to returning to the U.S. this weekend, but as I got off the plane at LAX on Sunday, I wasn't sure what country I was coming back to.

President Trump’s recent executive order is not only potentially unconstitutional, but deeply un-American. We are a nation of immigrants, after all. In the tech world, we often talk about a startup’s “unfair advantage” that allows it to beat competitors. Welcoming immigrants and refugees has been our country's unfair advantage, and coming from an immigrant family has been mine as an entrepreneur.

As many of you know, I am the son of an undocumented immigrant from Germany and the great grandson of refugees who fled the Armenian Genocide.

A little over a century ago, a Turkish soldier decided my great grandfather was too young to kill after cutting down his parents in front of him; instead of turning the sword on the boy, the soldier sent him to an orphanage. Many Armenians, including my great grandmother, found sanctuary in Aleppo, Syria—before the two reconnected and found their way to Ellis Island. Thankfully they weren't retained, rather they found this message:

*“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”*

My great grandfather didn’t speak much English, but he worked hard, and was able to get a job at Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company in Binghamton, NY. That was his family's golden door. And though he and my great grandmother had four children, all born in the U.S., immigration continued to reshape their family, generation after generation. The one son they had—my grandfather [(here’s his AMA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29039l/iam_john_ohanian_92_year_old_lawyer_parttime/)—volunteered to serve in the Second World War and married a French-Armenian immigrant. And my mother, a native of Hamburg, Germany, decided to leave her friends, family, and education behind after falling in love with my father, who was born in San Francisco.

She got a student visa, came to the U.S. and then worked as an au pair, uprooting her entire life for love in a foreign land. She overstayed her visa. She should have left, but she didn't. After she and my father married, she received a green card, which she kept for over a decade until she became a citizen. I grew up speaking German, but she insisted I focus on my English in order to be successful. She eventually got her citizenship and I’ll never forget her swearing in ceremony.

If you’ve never seen people taking the pledge of allegiance for the first time as U.S. Citizens, it will move you: a room full of people who can really appreciate what I was lucky enough to grow up with, simply by being born in Brooklyn. It thrills me to write reference letters for enterprising founders who are looking to get visas to start their companies here, to create value and jobs for these United States.

My forebears were brave refugees who found a home in this country. I’ve always been proud to live in a country that said yes to these shell-shocked immigrants from a strange land, that created a path for a woman who wanted only to work hard and start a family here. 

Without them, there’s no me, and there’s no Reddit. We are Americans. Let’s not forget that we’ve thrived as a nation because we’ve been a beacon for the courageous—the tired, the poor, the tempest-tossed.

Right now, Lady Liberty’s lamp is dimming, which is why it's more important than ever that we speak out and show up to support all those for whom it shines—past, present, and future. I ask you to do this however you see fit, whether it's calling your representative (this works, it's how we defeated SOPA + PIPA), marching in protest, [donating to the ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/secure/donate-to-aclu), or voting, of course, and not just for Presidential elections.

Our platform, like our country, thrives the more people and communities we have within it. Reddit, Inc. will continue to welcome all citizens of the world to our digital community and our office.

—Alexis

"I’m excited to be back for my fifth AMA. 


Melinda and I recently published our latest Annual Letter: http://www.gatesletter.com.


This year it’s addressed to our dear friend Warren Buffett, who donated the bulk of his fortune to our foundation in 2006. In the letter we tell Warren about the impact his amazing gift has had on the world.


My idea for a David Pumpkins sequel at Saturday Night Live didn't make the cut last Christmas, but I thought it deserved a second chance: https://youtu.be/56dRczBgMiA.
