"FTP. On mobile. Sorry, this involved a lot of  necessary detail and it got long. I hope you can make it through...I think it’s worth it.  Also, some may think it’s  Petty revenge, but I think that since it involved judges and police, it will meet the minimum requirements for Pro. 


**BACKSTORY**
Before I met my now husband, he was married and divorced. We’ll call my husband “H” and his ex-wife “D”. Their’s was not a marriage of love, but a marriage of financial benefit. He was 19; she a little older. He was in college, but she couldn’t afford to go. He was able to get grants and some small loans to afford college because his parents were dead broke. Her estranged father made too much money to qualify. So they got married, so the powers that be to no longer considered her parents’ income into her “ability to pay” part of the application for grants. 


He worked in commercial real estate and went to school part time.  With his income and both their grants and loans, she was able to go to school full time, and they graduated at the same time. They stayed together through and a little bit after college...although they didn’t really love each other, they did like each other. He started making a decent living, and learned to appreciate the finer things in life. His upwardly mobile career allowed them to buy and sell their 1st house, and then buy a 2nd, nicer home. He also leased them both brand new cars. In 2000, my husband started to feel like their time together had passed its prime. She agreed. 


They started the divorce process, and since her job didn’t pay that much, he decided to give her: 

1) all the furnishings in their home (paid for by him)

2) agreement to finish out the remaining months on her very nice SUV’s lease (in his name and $500+ per month). 

3) half of his, not inconsequential, savings and retirement accounts (100% funded by him; she always spent any money she had left after bills on shoes and clothes...never opened or contributed to a savings account). 

He was very generous, considering our state would not have required he pay any alimony and only a split of commingled assets, and he had come into the marriage with a small sum of savings he never commingled that he could have kept. They used a divorce-in-the-box type place that does non-contested divorces on the cheap. They were amicably divorced 90 days later, and both dating their future spouses within a few months of that. 


My husband and I started dating in early 2001 (2-3 months after the divorce was final). A year and a half after the divorce, I moved in with my husband, and she married her boyfriend. 


**HER SCREW UP**
A few months later, my husband really wanted to make an upward job change (different position in the same industry), which would significantly lower his income for a short time, but result in significantly more income after about a year of ramp up. My income could just barely cover all our bills, my (soon to be) car payment (my car was on its last legs and I desperately needed a new car) and his car payment, but I didn’t have enough to cover his ex-wife’s $500+\mo., car payment. He decided that, since D was remarried, he should not have to continuing paying for it and should be able to take the car back, and I could drive that instead of buying a new one myself. He thought it was fair, and he read his divorce decree and felt it was possible. We consulted a lawyer, who agreed that asking for it back was fair, and although it wasn’t written into the divorce decree as “alimony” it will likely be treated as such if they ended up going to court, so he had a good chance of winning. 


H called D to explain the situation.  He asked her for the SUV back, but she said “no” and ended the conversation.  He called her a week later, and asked again, stating that if she still refuses, he will take her to court. She said she had spoken to her husband, and they weren’t going to give the car back. As an alternative, H asked if they could take over paying all, or at least some, of the car payment, as the $500+\mo. would negatively impact his career advancement. They said they spoke to a lawyer and refused to pay a penny of the payment. On to the next option: court. Our lawyer had laid out a plan for doing it without representation, so he went to the courthouse the next day and filed his complaint.


A few days later, D calls and said she had been summoned by the court, and she and her husband wanted to come over and see if they could work something out without going to court. Great! We figured she had seen that these $500+ car payments were basically alimony, and she really can’t have her ex-husband paying for her car now that she’s remarried!  She’s seen the light!  But this is r/ProRevenge...we know better than that. 


The night she and her husband came over, their solution was not to give the car back...no, their solution was: he turn in the $500+ per month vehicle, pay the early lease termination penalty, and get her a (new 36 month) lease on a different, cheaper car...say a $250 one.  Considering there were around 18 months left on the $500+ month, that would actually cost him more money in the long run with the penalty. That was a big NO. Then she said “well, I talked to a lawyer, and he doesn’t think you have a snowballs chance in hell of winning in court.”  H: “Okay, have a goodnight. Bye”.  And out they went, feeling like they won. 


**THE REVENGE**
The court date came, and H shows up in court. D?  Nowhere to be seen. His case gets called...still no D.  The judge reads the complaint, listens to H’d story, and makes his judgement; paraphrasing: “I don’t think my ruling would be any different had she showed up to court, but we’ll never know. I hereby declare a default judgement in favor of the Plaintiff”.  Once H received a printed copy of the judgement, he hatched his plan. 


1- He called D, told her he won the case and asked her for the keys. She said “no” and hung up on him. 
2- He went to the dealership to order 2 new keys. He had the VIN, and the car was in his, so no problem there. 
3- He knew where she worked and her schedule. He ordered a tow truck and requested a Sheriff’s officer at 3:45 for the next afternoon at her work. 

**D DAY**
3:45 the next day, 15 minutes before she would finish, he met up with the tow truck driver and the officer in the parking lot of her work. The officer  verified the documents, and they located and loaded the truck onto the flatbed. They moved the truck to the curb right outside the doors to D’s work.  A little after 4:00, D walks out, sees the trio and *her* car on the truck and freezes in her tracks. This is the paraphrased conversation that followed:

D: But you can’t do that. 

*H hands her the judgement; the officer reiterates the court’s judgement*

D: “but I talked to Joe. He said you didn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell of winning....those were Joe’s exact words...snowball’s. chance. in. hell”...*voice slightly cracking*

*H thinks for a second to try to figure out who Joe was. She had said it like he knew who Joe was. He tried to figure out a lawyer they both knew named Joe, but he could only think of their mortgage broker, Joe*

H: Joe, Joe?  Like our mortgage broker, Joe?  Your “lawyer” is a mortgage broker?

D: Yeah, he said that it wasn’t written into the divorce decree as alimony, so you couldn’t take it just because I got married

H: Well, the judge may or may not have agreed with you and *Joe*, but since you never showed up to court, you lost your opportunity to find out. 

She was left mouth opened, catching flies. He shook the officers hand, thanked him for his time, said to the truck driver “I’ll meet you back at my house”, said goodbye to D, and walked away.  Just when H neared his car, she screamed  “how am I supposed to get home?”. He replied “Call that pansy-ass of a man you call a husband that was okay with his wife’s *ex*-husband supporting her”. 


They get back to our house, unload the tow truck, and the driver was laughing his ass off. When he was finished he said “that was the best thing I’ve ever been a part of on the job”. He ended up discounting the tow by a bit, saying that’s to makeup you for having to be married to that entitled woman”. 


I sold my SUV within a week, and I took over the payments for his exes car.  Their divorce was no longer amicable, we got married, had a kid, and lived happily ever after. 


Moral of the story: pay for your own shit and don’t no-show if you’ve been summoned to court...even if you think the plaintiff doesn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell of winning...rather. *especially* if the plaintiff doesn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell of winning. 

TLDR: my husband supported his previous wife who didn’t work for the first 5 years of their relationship. When they divorced, it was written in he would continue paying the lease on her vehicle (basically alimony in the form of a car payment). She remarried, and he continued paying the lease for a year, but when we needed extra cash and/or a car, her and her new husband refused to give up the car or contribute at all to the payments. Took her to court, she no-showed. We won by default. Took her car from her. 

ETA
I’m getting a lot of comments that by husband broke a contract he made with her to make the payments, so I wanted to explain the difference between a divorce decree and a contract. 

A divorce decree is not a contract. Contracts/agreements would be created and agreed to outside of the divorce decree, then incorporated as an exhibit. 

> A settlement agreement is incorporated into a divorce decree usually by reference to it in the decree. The decree will generally state that the agreement is attached as an exhibit or it will merely reference that the parties have reached an agreement that has been filed with and approved by the court.

This situation was not a separate contract, incorporated as an exhibit. This was a part of the divorce decree, and divorce decrees can be, and frequently are, altered if and when the marital or financial status of either party changes significantly.   Additionally, the decree stated, in multiple places, that changes in marital or financial status, of either party, is just cause to request a review by the court, with the potential of altering the decree.  

So basically, you can’t rely or make major life decisions based on the expectation of receiving alimony. If your ex looses his job, you can legally lose your alimony.

D: “but I talked to Joe. He said you didn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell of winning....those were Joe’s exact words...snowball’s. chance. in. hell”...*voice slightly cracking*

*H thinks for a second to try to figure out who Joe was. She had said it like he knew who Joe was. He tried to figure out a lawyer they both knew named Joe, but he could only think of their mortgage broker, Joe*

H: Joe, Joe?  Like our mortgage broker, Joe?  Your “lawyer” is a mortgage broker?

D: Yeah, he said that it wasn’t written into the divorce decree as alimony, so you couldn’t take it just because I got married

H: Well, the judge may or may not have agreed with you and *Joe*, but since you never showed up to court, you lost your opportunity to find out. 

She was left mouth opened, catching flies. He shook the officers hand, thanked him for his time, said to the truck driver “I’ll meet you back at my house”, said goodbye to D, and walked away.  Just when H neared his car, she screamed  “how am I supposed to get home?”. He replied “Call that pansy-ass of a man you call a husband that was okay with his wife’s *ex*-husband supporting her”. 


They get back to our house, unload the tow truck, and the driver was laughing his ass off. When he was finished he said “that was the best thing I’ve ever been a part of on the job”. He ended up discounting the tow by a bit, saying that’s to makeup you for having to be married to that entitled woman”. 


I sold my SUV within a week, and I took over the payments for his exes car.  Their divorce was no longer amicable, we got married, had a kid, and lived happily ever after. 


Moral of the story: pay for your own shit and don’t no-show if you’ve been summoned to court...even if you think the plaintiff doesn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell of winning...rather. *especially* if the plaintiff doesn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell of winning. 

TLDR: my husband supported his previous wife who didn’t work for the first 5 years of their relationship. When they divorced, it was written in he would continue paying the lease on her vehicle (basically alimony in the form of a car payment). She remarried, and he continued paying the lease for a year, but when we needed extra cash and/or a car, her and her new husband refused to give up the car or contribute at all to the payments. Took her to court, she no-showed. We won by default. Took her car from her. 

ETA
I’m getting a lot of comments that by husband broke a contract he made with her to make the payments, so I wanted to explain the difference between a divorce decree and a contract. 

A divorce decree is not a contract. Contracts/agreements would be created and agreed to outside of the divorce decree, then incorporated as an exhibit. 

> A settlement agreement is incorporated into a divorce decree usually by reference to it in the decree. The decree will generally state that the agreement is attached as an exhibit or it will merely reference that the parties have reached an agreement that has been filed with and approved by the court.

This situation was not a separate contract, incorporated as an exhibit. This was a part of the divorce decree, and divorce decrees can be, and frequently are, altered if and when the marital or financial status of either party changes significantly.   Additionally, the decree stated, in multiple places, that changes in marital or financial status, of either party, is just cause to request a review by the court, with the potential of altering the decree.  

So basically, you can’t rely or make major life decisions based on the expectation of receiving alimony. If your ex looses his job, you can legally lose your alimony.

"In high school I worked at a pizza place for two years.  I started out bussing tables and washing dishes.  Later I delivered pizzas and waited.  After that I learned how to make the dough, grease the pans, etc.

I worked 12-15 hours per week during the school year and as much as I could in the summer.  I worked on short notice when someone didn't show up.  I wasn't the best employee, but I knew how to show up.

My last summer there I was usually scheduled for 32 hours, but they would call me in a lot.  One payday I got my check --and a lecture from the owner-- because I worked 56 hours in one week.  He explained that they did not want to pay overtime so I needed to keep track and inform the manager if I was over 40 hours.  [Well, that sucks.]

The next week I was scheduled for 12 hours.  I talked to the manager, who told me not to worry because I would be the first one they would call if they needed someone to cover a shift.  
     ""Why don't you just schedule me for 40 hours and call someone else in?""  
     ""Because we know you will come if we need you.""
I only worked about 20 hours that week.

I was bitching about it to a friend, who hooked me up with a job at another restaurant.  They agreed to work around my pizza schedule.  

Despite a dozen calls, I never worked another unscheduled shift at the pizza place.  The manager asked me why I quit coming in and I told him I found another job.

"Everytime I find myself on this sub writing another story about my workplace I can't wait until I no longer have to work here.

On to the malicious compliance. So, this is a grocery store, when we're working the front of the store it's pretty consistently busy, so myself and the rest of the shift managers would allow cashiers to have water bottles under the register to sip when they don't have customers. While this was against store policy nobody really ever cared as long as they weren't drinking from them while they had a customer at their line. Well, the store manager changed his mind and banned water bottles at workstations for reasons unknown. I looked it up in he company policy and discovered that it has a rule stating something to the effect of ""all employees will have free and unlimited access to water at all times."" I bring this up to him and he says that's fine just have them go over to our dining area, grab a drink and then toss the cup when they're done. This is annoying and unnecessary, but whatever. Now comes the compliance. It's relatively easy to let cashiers run off for a minute to get drink when they needed, and they didn't abuse it. Now for the managers we're not allowed to leave the front without someone to watch it for us so that basically meant  that we couldn't have water very often if at all. One day in the morning it's just myself and the store manager in at the time. I usually drink anywhere from 1/2 - 1 gallon of water in a shift. What do I do? I proceed to radio him up to the front to cover me every 10 minutes so that I can go drink some water. He begrudgingly does this 3 times before bitching about it which I just reply by stating the company policy to him. He comes up and covers me again.

"So I recently had to work at a homeless shelter/food kitchen for a week to get community service hours for school. It was the standard cook food, sweep the floors, and wash dishes kind of community service, no big deal. After a few days you begin to see patterns in certain people. Some of who were on their last leg trying to get something to eat, very sad, and some who wasn’t homeless at all and just looking for a handout, very annoying...

On one of the days Mellow Mushroom donated a bunch of pizza they couldn’t sell. For lunch that day everyone got a water and 2 slices of pizza. The rules are that everyone gets their first round of food, and IF there is any left over we announce that you can get a second round. 

So there is the one guy, who clearly wasn’t homeless, coming in everyday to get food, not a problem I guess, until he goes and get his second before anyone else. I politely told him he has to wait until everyone got their first round. Once everyone did, he was the first person to get his seconds. 

Upon cutting to the front of the line, he asks me if we had any pepperoni pizza. I politely tell him that we just ran out and that there was a bunch of others he could have.

"*The following maintenance requests and complaints were found on the computer of one Mrs. Doris May, the landlord of the apartment building at 2618 Wayne Boulevard, following the thorough search of the building by the police.*

**Donald Fitzgerald \- Unit 411**

**January 13**

My wife and I moved here for the proximity to the subway and for the cheap rent. But we did NOT move here so we wouldn’t have a working stove. I do not plan on eating take out for the remainder of my tenure at this building. I demand maintenance come down at ONCE and fix this! Unacceptable!

**January 24**

And now the REFRIGERATOR isn’t working?! The refrigerator temperature should be at a nice, cool 34 degrees Fahrenheit but try as we might Patricia and I have been unable to get it below 36 degrees so now our MILK is spoiled, the CHEESE is molded, my YOGURT is inedible, and my BEERS are NOT chilled the way I’d like when I get home from a long day at work. Once again I demand a maintenance representative be here TOMORROW to fix this. And NOT the same man as last time. Jose was rude and did not even apologize for all of this inconvenience when we yelled at him.

**February 8**

It seems we can’t go a single day without finding something unacceptable about this building. At night time both Patricia and I hear a faint but constant thumping in the walls. What is that? I demand to know why we cannot get some peace and quiet.

**February 12**

If our WiFi drops out in the middle of Patricia’s stories ONE MORE TIME there will be HELL TO PAY. Get the ISP down here now to increase our speeds. This is insane.

**February 18**

It appears my previous DEMAND went unheeded. Last night the thumping was far worse. It sounds like a ghost is living in the walls. PATRICIA HATES GHOSTS. They are RUDE and UNINVITED and do NASTY THINGS like SLAM DOORS AND BREAK CHINA DISHES. GET A JOB, GHOSTS! Patricia can’t sleep in these conditions and I hereby demand an exorcist be brought to the premises to deal with this at once. AT ONCE!

**February 27**

The REFRIGERATOR IS ACTING UP AGAIN. I thought this was FIXED?!?!?! The expiration date on my milk says use by March 3 but it is NOT MARCH 3 YET AND ALREADY MY MILK IS STARTING TO SMELL. THE TEMPERATURE IS 36 DEGREES AND RISING. UNACCEPTABLE!!!!

**March 4**

So today I came home from work and go to hang up my coat and what did I find? A bouquet of flowers from the downstairs office thanking us for being DREAM TENANTS WHO ALWAYS PAY RENT ON TIME?!?!?!?!?! NO!!!! I FOUND A COLD SPOT BY THE BEDROOM DOOR. The air is of an ACCEPTABLE BUT NOT IDEAL temperature throughout our apartment. But by the door to our bedroom there is a COLD SPOT. This indicates the presence of a SPIRITUAL ENTITY and I do NOT pay $1800 a month to be HAUNTED in my OWN HOME! Unacceptable. I demand this be dealt with at once. AT!!! ONCE!!!!!

**March 7**

Thank you for fixing the stove but I did not appreciate how Jose made me feel stupid for not knowing about the pilot light feature. I expect he will be reprimanded appropriately.

**March 11**

Yesterday I had a run in with Paul Schummermann from down the hall. He was very rude to me when I asked him to stop staring at us venomously whenever we see him. Do you know what he did? He CONTINUED TO STARE AS IF HE WISHES HARM UPON ME. I demand to know what will be done about PAUL SCHUMMERMANN.

**March 14**

So apparently it is not just Paul Schummermann who is bizarre and RUDE. Rosa Martinez \- the elderly foreign woman with maybe FIVE OR SIX REMAINING TEETH from FLOOR 3 \- smiled at us in a VERY EVIL LOOKING WAY THAT I DID NOT APPRECIATE WHEN I WAS GETTING OUR MAIL! I demand to know what will be done about ROSA MARTINEZ.

**March 14**

I know I just submitted a request but it is 10:45 and Patricia is unable to sleep because of her nightmares. She says she can see a black figure standing at the end of our bed with red eyes. NOT OKAY. WAS SOMEONE MURDERED IN THIS UNIT? ANSWERS!

**March 16**

It is unacceptable that on JAMES MADISON’S BIRTHDAY we cannot get the heat to stay on. The temperature is at FORTY DEGREES. MUCH TOO COLD!! FIX THIS!

**March 17**

Still too cold! And do you mind explaining why all the pictures of Patricia and myself in our hallway were SMASHED AND BROKEN ON THE GROUND?!?!?! I am calling an exorcist since you refuse to do so and RENT WILL BE REDUCED BY THE COST OF HIS SERVICES.

**March 19**

We brought in a local priest who says that GUESS WHAT? ITS NOT A GHOST, ITS A DEMON. A DEMON INFESTS MY HUMBLE ABODE AS I WRITE THIS. Do you think this is an acceptable way to run an apartment?! NO! IT IS NOT!!! I asked what we can DO about the situation and he says we should LEAVE IMMEDIATELY because if we don’t the demon will LATCH ON TO US AND FOLLOW US AROUND. I AM NOT RELOCATING THIS SOON! I asked him to deal with it and he said he can’t, that its beyond his ability to fight and that we need to have the ENTIRE BUILDING FULLY BLESSED. He then scheduled a time tomorrow for he and several other priests, rabbis and pastors to arrive and do a thorough BLESSING OF THE BUILDING. YOU WILL BE BILLED FOR THIS.

**March 19**

Once again I cannot sleep. Patricia is sleepwalking YET AGAIN except instead of walking down the hall or SCREAMING while STILL ASLEEP from the KITCHEN, she is CRAWLING ON THE CEILING AND SHOUTING AT ME IN A VERY DEEP VOICE WHILE HER HEAD TWISTS FULLY AROUND LIKE AN OWL. I told her to get down at once and she said ‘NO. SHE IS MINE.’ Excuse me, DEMON! She is NOT! I HAVE WORK IN THE MORNING but what I do not have is PATIENCE FOR THIS NONSENSE. OH! And when I told the demon to let us sleep it said F me. F ME?!?! I DO NOT APPRECIATE THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE! NO, SIR! Then she began hissing and SPITTING STEAMING BILE ONTO THE BED AND LAUGHING MANIACALLY. MY BLANKET IS RUINED!!! I am TYPING THIS ON MY LAPTOP FROM THE COUCH WHILE SHE SHOUTS BLASPHEMIES FROM DOWN THE HALL. If these priests do not fix this issue we will be reporting YOU for this mess.

**March 20**

Do you mind explaining to me why there are HERBS and TWIGS by my door beneath a sign of a pentagram? I expect this is the work of PAUL SCHUMMERMANN or ROSA MARTINEZ or that nasty DYLAN FRENCH FROM UNIT 221. You need to do a better job picking TENANTS FOR THIS ESTABLISHMENT.

**March 20**

So I come inside and Patricia is gone. Her absence was not arranged beforehand and I expect it has something to do with the demon. This is NOT OKAY. When I come home from work I expect to be able to relax in front of a game show with a beer while my wife knits. But that is NOT GOING TO BE THE CASE TODAY, APPARENTLY. There are scratched PENTAGRAMS all over the WALLS, BROKEN LAMPS, THE LIGHTS DON’T WORK, THE REFRIGERATOR DOOR IS HANGING OPEN, THUS RUINING YET MORE MILK! MORE! MILK! GONE! AND the entire apartment is FREEZING! I will be doing a thorough search through this building for my wife, updating you on ANY UNPLEASANTRIES I ENCOUNTER from my PHONE as NEEDED, and when I get back I expect Jose will have FIXED THE LIGHTS.

**March 20**

It appears these tenants knew I was coming. I am on floor three and they are all STANDING OUTSIDE THEIR HOMES watching me. SILENTLY. UNMOVING AS I WALK DOWN THE HALLWAY BETWEEN THEM. And I believe I smell MARIJUANA FROM THE GAY COUPLE’S HOME. MARIJUANA! AN ILLEGAL DRUG THAT KILLS MILLIONS EVERY YEAR. IN YOUR BUILDING! DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. I WILL NOT HAVE THE DEVIL’S GANJA SO CLOSE TO MY ABODE!! IF THE POLICE CONDUCT A SWAT RAID LOOKING FOR MARIJUANA WE ALL GO TO FEDERAL PRISON! ALL OF US!!

**March 20**

I have decided I cannot abide the presence of such a terrifying drug as marijuana anywhere near my person, my wife, or my place of residence. I have alerted the authorities and they are en route. I apologize if a life sentence for you is inconvenient but I had no other choice.

**March 20**

So I asked sweet Mrs. Robinson from unit 334 where my wife was and she said the basement. THE BASEMENT?! I go down there for LAUNDRY, NOT MY WIFE. Also I hereby and henceforth demand that a WASHER/DRYER UNIT, PREFERABLY STACKED ALTHOUGH I AM WILLING TO NEGOTIATE ON THIS, BE PLACED IN OUR UNIT WHEN THIS UNFORTUNATE EPISODE IS CONCLUDED. I do not LIKE going into the basement with a BASKET of dirty laundry TWICE OR THREE TIMES A MONTH because I have to use the STAIRS because YOU can’t get your ELEVATOR WORKING.

**March 20**

WHY ARE THE LIGHTS OFF ON FLOOR 2?? AND WHERE ARE THE PRIESTS. ALL I SEE ARE MORE TENANTS POINTING IN UNISON DOWN THE STAIRS WHILE STARING AT ME LIKE THEY ARE IN A TRANCE. It smells like ROTTING CORPSES and OLD FOOD DOWN HERE. MAYBE OLD LASAGNA. This was NOT THE CASE when I left for work this morning although TOO BE FAIR I simply walked down the stairs and did not VENTURE down THIS HALLWAY. I also did not notice the arrows PAINTED IN BLOOD pointing downstairs. I assume those were put up while I was at work?!

**March 20**

To\* be fair. My apologies.

**March 20**

Where is the front door?! I am on FLOOR ONE and the front door is MISSING? I JUST USED IT. Instead there is just a SWIRLING VORTEX of IMPENETRABLE BLACKNESS with BLOOD coming out of it and STAINING THE NICE CARPET. I expect this will be FIXED as I have WORK TOMORROW and need to be there EARLY so I can PREPARE for a PRESENTATION ON SALES REPORTS FROM QUARTER ONE! QUARTER!!! ONE!!!!!!!!!!

**March 20**

I have now reached the door to the basement. Why is the word ‘COME’ scratched repeatedly into the wood here? UNSIGHTLY.

**March 20**

I am at the top of the basement stairs. Did you know there are demonic voices WHISPERING TO PEOPLE DOWN HERE? Saying to COME DOWN STAIRS WITH US! JOIN US! JOIN US! JOIN US! Over and over again!! Why do they feel the need to REPEAT themselves?! This is INEFFICIENT!!!

**March 20**

The voices are now saying that the Gospel is a lie but I said NOTHING about the first four books of the New Testament. This is an IRRELEVANT RED HERRING and I demand we replace these demons with ones who can AT LEAST STAY ON TOPIC. I am here for my WIFE and NOT to debate the minutiae of Judeo\-Christian theology with malevolent spiritual entities who, if I’m being perfectly honest, cannot be trusted on the matter because they CLEARLY have a vested interest in me feeling one way or another as far as this subject is concerned and are thus NOT BEING OBJECTIVE. If this keeps up then I will be taking my laundry to the LAUNDROMAT down on Block and Charter for the foreseeable future and YOU will lose out on my business in that department.

**March 20**

Well I now see where the PRIESTS have gone. Their bones are SCATTERED across the basement and their collective blood is swirling in a vortex around what appears to be a PORTAL TO HELL in the center of the basement, around which ALL THE TENANTS of the ground floor are seated and worshipping. I BELIEVE I SAID VERY CLEARLY THAT I DID NOT WANT HELL PORTALS IN MY PLACE OF RESIDENCE AND NO ONE SEEMED TO INDICATE THIS WOULD BE A PROBLEM WHEN I SIGNED THE LEASE. If I am EVER to use these washing and drying machines again I expect the gateway to Hades to be CLOSED and the place to be cleaned THOROUGHLY before I do so! The smell is TERRIBLE and I also demand that the GLOWING FIERY PENTAGRAM in the floor beneath the portal be DOUSED AND CLEANED OFF. IT IS DETRIMENTAL TO WHAT LITTLE DECOR THERE IS IN THIS BASEMENT.

**March 20**

Well all the tenants now SEE me but as of this typing HAVE YET TO RESPOND TO MY DEMANDS TO SEE MY WIFE. They are simply staring at me and I’m sorry, where are there eyes? Are eyes not FASHIONABLE anymore? HOW CAN THEY SEE ME IF THEY HAVE NO EYES? This is IMPOSSIBLE and I DEMAND they cease it at once. They have NO RESPECT for the rules of EITHER THIS APARTMENT OR PHYSICS ITSELF. This day is RUINED.

**March 20**

Their\* eyes.

**March 20**

My wife, who is quite UNKEMPT and whose hair appears to be UNWASHED and who looks like she is possessed with Satan \(UNACCEPTABLE!\), has joined the group as they speak to me in UNISON. I’m sorry, WHEN WAS THERE A GROUP PRACTICE FOR THIS PERFORMANCE AND WHY WAS I NOT INVITED? It is quite RUDE to exclude members of your own apartment from such group ACTIVITIES as theater and LATIN CLASSES, APPARENTLY. And also, I assume this strange, deep voice they are singing in belongs to the TOWERING, HORNED BEAST THAT HAS STEPPED THROUGH THE PORTAL AND IS POINTING A CLAWED FINGER AT ME AND APPROACHING ME SLOWLY IN AN AGGRESSIVE MANNER THAT I DO. NOT. APPRECIATE.

Who is HE? Does he pay RENT?! Do you let just ANYONE ENTER THIS BUILDING EVEN IF THEY DON’T PAY RENT?! AND IF SO, THEN I DEMAND, HEREBY, HENCEFORTH, AND AT ONCE, BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME AS A LAWFUL CITIZEN AND AS A RESIDENT OF THIS APARTMENT WHO IS NOT NOR EVER HAS BEEN DELINQUENT ON THE PAYMENT OF RENT NOR ANY OTHER AGREED UPON EXPENSES, THAT [1238T1asdgn’;.?TG789’;.@../#](https://www.facebook.com/thejesseclarknosleep/)",89,1527995302.0,8o2thu,False,"*The following maintenance requests and complaints were found on the computer of one Mrs. Doris May, the landlord of the apartment building at 2618 Wayne Boulevard, following the thorough search of the building by the police.*

**Donald Fitzgerald \- Unit 411**

**January 13**

My wife and I moved here for the proximity to the subway and for the cheap rent. But we did NOT move here so we wouldn’t have a working stove. I do not plan on eating take out for the remainder of my tenure at this building. I demand maintenance come down at ONCE and fix this! Unacceptable!

**January 24**

And now the REFRIGERATOR isn’t working?! The refrigerator temperature should be at a nice, cool 34 degrees Fahrenheit but try as we might Patricia and I have been unable to get it below 36 degrees so now our MILK is spoiled, the CHEESE is molded, my YOGURT is inedible, and my BEERS are NOT chilled the way I’d like when I get home from a long day at work. Once again I demand a maintenance representative be here TOMORROW to fix this. And NOT the same man as last time. Jose was rude and did not even apologize for all of this inconvenience when we yelled at him.

**February 8**

It seems we can’t go a single day without finding something unacceptable about this building. At night time both Patricia and I hear a faint but constant thumping in the walls. What is that? I demand to know why we cannot get some peace and quiet.

**February 12**

If our WiFi drops out in the middle of Patricia’s stories ONE MORE TIME there will be HELL TO PAY. Get the ISP down here now to increase our speeds. This is insane.

**February 18**

It appears my previous DEMAND went unheeded. Last night the thumping was far worse. It sounds like a ghost is living in the walls. PATRICIA HATES GHOSTS. They are RUDE and UNINVITED and do NASTY THINGS like SLAM DOORS AND BREAK CHINA DISHES. GET A JOB, GHOSTS! Patricia can’t sleep in these conditions and I hereby demand an exorcist be brought to the premises to deal with this at once. AT ONCE!

**February 27**

The REFRIGERATOR IS ACTING UP AGAIN. I thought this was FIXED?!?!?! The expiration date on my milk says use by March 3 but it is NOT MARCH 3 YET AND ALREADY MY MILK IS STARTING TO SMELL. THE TEMPERATURE IS 36 DEGREES AND RISING. UNACCEPTABLE!!!!

**March 4**

So today I came home from work and go to hang up my coat and what did I find? A bouquet of flowers from the downstairs office thanking us for being DREAM TENANTS WHO ALWAYS PAY RENT ON TIME?!?!?!?!?! NO!!!! I FOUND A COLD SPOT BY THE BEDROOM DOOR. The air is of an ACCEPTABLE BUT NOT IDEAL temperature throughout our apartment. But by the door to our bedroom there is a COLD SPOT. This indicates the presence of a SPIRITUAL ENTITY and I do NOT pay $1800 a month to be HAUNTED in my OWN HOME! Unacceptable. I demand this be dealt with at once. AT!!! ONCE!!!!!

**March 7**

Thank you for fixing the stove but I did not appreciate how Jose made me feel stupid for not knowing about the pilot light feature. I expect he will be reprimanded appropriately.

**March 11**

Yesterday I had a run in with Paul Schummermann from down the hall. He was very rude to me when I asked him to stop staring at us venomously whenever we see him. Do you know what he did? He CONTINUED TO STARE AS IF HE WISHES HARM UPON ME. I demand to know what will be done about PAUL SCHUMMERMANN.

**March 14**

So apparently it is not just Paul Schummermann who is bizarre and RUDE. Rosa Martinez \- the elderly foreign woman with maybe FIVE OR SIX REMAINING TEETH from FLOOR 3 \- smiled at us in a VERY EVIL LOOKING WAY THAT I DID NOT APPRECIATE WHEN I WAS GETTING OUR MAIL! I demand to know what will be done about ROSA MARTINEZ.

**March 14**

I know I just submitted a request but it is 10:45 and Patricia is unable to sleep because of her nightmares. She says she can see a black figure standing at the end of our bed with red eyes. NOT OKAY. WAS SOMEONE MURDERED IN THIS UNIT? ANSWERS!

**March 16**

It is unacceptable that on JAMES MADISON’S BIRTHDAY we cannot get the heat to stay on. The temperature is at FORTY DEGREES. MUCH TOO COLD!! FIX THIS!

**March 17**

Still too cold! And do you mind explaining why all the pictures of Patricia and myself in our hallway were SMASHED AND BROKEN ON THE GROUND?!?!?! I am calling an exorcist since you refuse to do so and RENT WILL BE REDUCED BY THE COST OF HIS SERVICES.

**March 19**

We brought in a local priest who says that GUESS WHAT? ITS NOT A GHOST, ITS A DEMON. A DEMON INFESTS MY HUMBLE ABODE AS I WRITE THIS. Do you think this is an acceptable way to run an apartment?! NO! IT IS NOT!!! I asked what we can DO about the situation and he says we should LEAVE IMMEDIATELY because if we don’t the demon will LATCH ON TO US AND FOLLOW US AROUND. I AM NOT RELOCATING THIS SOON! I asked him to deal with it and he said he can’t, that its beyond his ability to fight and that we need to have the ENTIRE BUILDING FULLY BLESSED. He then scheduled a time tomorrow for he and several other priests, rabbis and pastors to arrive and do a thorough BLESSING OF THE BUILDING. YOU WILL BE BILLED FOR THIS.

**March 19**

Once again I cannot sleep. Patricia is sleepwalking YET AGAIN except instead of walking down the hall or SCREAMING while STILL ASLEEP from the KITCHEN, she is CRAWLING ON THE CEILING AND SHOUTING AT ME IN A VERY DEEP VOICE WHILE HER HEAD TWISTS FULLY AROUND LIKE AN OWL. I told her to get down at once and she said ‘NO. SHE IS MINE.’ Excuse me, DEMON! She is NOT! I HAVE WORK IN THE MORNING but what I do not have is PATIENCE FOR THIS NONSENSE. OH! And when I told the demon to let us sleep it said F me. F ME?!?! I DO NOT APPRECIATE THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE! NO, SIR! Then she began hissing and SPITTING STEAMING BILE ONTO THE BED AND LAUGHING MANIACALLY. MY BLANKET IS RUINED!!! I am TYPING THIS ON MY LAPTOP FROM THE COUCH WHILE SHE SHOUTS BLASPHEMIES FROM DOWN THE HALL. If these priests do not fix this issue we will be reporting YOU for this mess.

**March 20**

Do you mind explaining to me why there are HERBS and TWIGS by my door beneath a sign of a pentagram? I expect this is the work of PAUL SCHUMMERMANN or ROSA MARTINEZ or that nasty DYLAN FRENCH FROM UNIT 221. You need to do a better job picking TENANTS FOR THIS ESTABLISHMENT.

**March 20**

So I come inside and Patricia is gone. Her absence was not arranged beforehand and I expect it has something to do with the demon. This is NOT OKAY. When I come home from work I expect to be able to relax in front of a game show with a beer while my wife knits. But that is NOT GOING TO BE THE CASE TODAY, APPARENTLY. There are scratched PENTAGRAMS all over the WALLS, BROKEN LAMPS, THE LIGHTS DON’T WORK, THE REFRIGERATOR DOOR IS HANGING OPEN, THUS RUINING YET MORE MILK! MORE! MILK! GONE! AND the entire apartment is FREEZING! I will be doing a thorough search through this building for my wife, updating you on ANY UNPLEASANTRIES I ENCOUNTER from my PHONE as NEEDED, and when I get back I expect Jose will have FIXED THE LIGHTS.

**March 20**

It appears these tenants knew I was coming. I am on floor three and they are all STANDING OUTSIDE THEIR HOMES watching me. SILENTLY. UNMOVING AS I WALK DOWN THE HALLWAY BETWEEN THEM. And I believe I smell MARIJUANA FROM THE GAY COUPLE’S HOME. MARIJUANA! AN ILLEGAL DRUG THAT KILLS MILLIONS EVERY YEAR. IN YOUR BUILDING! DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. I WILL NOT HAVE THE DEVIL’S GANJA SO CLOSE TO MY ABODE!! IF THE POLICE CONDUCT A SWAT RAID LOOKING FOR MARIJUANA WE ALL GO TO FEDERAL PRISON! ALL OF US!!

**March 20**

I have decided I cannot abide the presence of such a terrifying drug as marijuana anywhere near my person, my wife, or my place of residence. I have alerted the authorities and they are en route. I apologize if a life sentence for you is inconvenient but I had no other choice.

**March 20**

So I asked sweet Mrs. Robinson from unit 334 where my wife was and she said the basement. THE BASEMENT?! I go down there for LAUNDRY, NOT MY WIFE. Also I hereby and henceforth demand that a WASHER/DRYER UNIT, PREFERABLY STACKED ALTHOUGH I AM WILLING TO NEGOTIATE ON THIS, BE PLACED IN OUR UNIT WHEN THIS UNFORTUNATE EPISODE IS CONCLUDED. I do not LIKE going into the basement with a BASKET of dirty laundry TWICE OR THREE TIMES A MONTH because I have to use the STAIRS because YOU can’t get your ELEVATOR WORKING.

**March 20**

WHY ARE THE LIGHTS OFF ON FLOOR 2?? AND WHERE ARE THE PRIESTS. ALL I SEE ARE MORE TENANTS POINTING IN UNISON DOWN THE STAIRS WHILE STARING AT ME LIKE THEY ARE IN A TRANCE. It smells like ROTTING CORPSES and OLD FOOD DOWN HERE. MAYBE OLD LASAGNA. This was NOT THE CASE when I left for work this morning although TOO BE FAIR I simply walked down the stairs and did not VENTURE down THIS HALLWAY. I also did not notice the arrows PAINTED IN BLOOD pointing downstairs. I assume those were put up while I was at work?!

**March 20**

To\* be fair. My apologies.

**March 20**

Where is the front door?! I am on FLOOR ONE and the front door is MISSING? I JUST USED IT. Instead there is just a SWIRLING VORTEX of IMPENETRABLE BLACKNESS with BLOOD coming out of it and STAINING THE NICE CARPET. I expect this will be FIXED as I have WORK TOMORROW and need to be there EARLY so I can PREPARE for a PRESENTATION ON SALES REPORTS FROM QUARTER ONE! QUARTER!!! ONE!!!!!!!!!!

**March 20**

I have now reached the door to the basement. Why is the word ‘COME’ scratched repeatedly into the wood here? UNSIGHTLY.

**March 20**

I am at the top of the basement stairs. Did you know there are demonic voices WHISPERING TO PEOPLE DOWN HERE? Saying to COME DOWN STAIRS WITH US! JOIN US! JOIN US! JOIN US! Over and over again!! Why do they feel the need to REPEAT themselves?! This is INEFFICIENT!!!

**March 20**

The voices are now saying that the Gospel is a lie but I said NOTHING about the first four books of the New Testament. This is an IRRELEVANT RED HERRING and I demand we replace these demons with ones who can AT LEAST STAY ON TOPIC. I am here for my WIFE and NOT to debate the minutiae of Judeo\-Christian theology with malevolent spiritual entities who, if I’m being perfectly honest, cannot be trusted on the matter because they CLEARLY have a vested interest in me feeling one way or another as far as this subject is concerned and are thus NOT BEING OBJECTIVE. If this keeps up then I will be taking my laundry to the LAUNDROMAT down on Block and Charter for the foreseeable future and YOU will lose out on my business in that department.

The smell is TERRIBLE and I also demand that the GLOWING FIERY PENTAGRAM in the floor beneath the portal be DOUSED AND CLEANED OFF. IT IS DETRIMENTAL TO WHAT LITTLE DECOR THERE IS IN THIS BASEMENT.

**March 20**

WL: Why didn't anybody tell us that when we checked in?    
Me: I wasn't the one who checked you in today; did you ask about the pool when you were checking in?    
WL: I was wearing my bathing suit.    
Me: (It's not my job to assume why you're here or judge what you're wearing) Okay, well unfortunately I cannot open the pool for you today.    
WL: Well can I get a refund then?    
Me: It looks like you paid with cash, so I can't authorize a refund, but let me call my manager and see what she says.    
    
*My manager tells me to inspect the room, and proceed with refund if nothing is used. I go up to the room and the smell of weed hits me like a brick wall, but nothing has been touched. I call my manager back, refund is a no-go*      
    
Me: Alright, unfortunately since the room has been smoked in already, we cannot authorize a refund.    
WL: But it's a smoking room.    
Me: I understand, but we are unable to rent the room out again tonight because it wouldn't smell fresh to the next guest.    
WL: Call your manager! This is bullshit! I want to talk to your manager! (I call my manager, manager agrees to talk to them) I didn't smoke in the room! I didn't smoke that! It was a black n mild! Plus, we smoked it outside of the door! Okay, well I'll call the cops and we can let them decide if it smells like weed! And then we'll take you to court! (Exit stage right).     
    
Manager calls: Call the cops. I'm not dealing with this shit today. They can leave.    
    
So the cops show up, and this lady comes down acting like hot shit with this smirk on her face. The cops go to her room, and then return to the front desk and ask if I want them evicted (uh, duh), so the cops go out to talk to WL and end up fining her because they found weed in her room.

"Well folks, I have made it to my first goal\- 100lbs of weight loss!!! 

It was 7 months ago \(almost to the day\) that I stumbled across r/keto, and instantly decided it was time for change! What was this incredible diet? Are these daily success stories real? \- The answers I had to find out on my own. 

After the first week, I found my motivation and I knew I’d make it here. Let me be clear, I feel amazing, but this is just the beginning! 

It has only been 7 months, and with the right attitude, the will to change, and support from friends, family, and all of the great information out there \(like r/keto!\), you can make just as much progress as I have. 

Everyone has a tendency to be extra hard on themselves.. I am one definitely one of those people! My best advice is to find forgiveness. Forgive yourself. Be proud of your victories \(even the smallest\), and don’t be afraid of failure. You will not fail. I promise after the first week or two, when you start gaining momentum, you will be making a post just like this one! 

One more thing.. Please do not compare your progress with the progress of others; You just keep doing you! Just the fact that you have decided to make a change will fuel you through your journey. 

I cant imagine what the next 7 months will bring. 

Cheers, and KCKO!

"So I recently had to work at a homeless shelter/food kitchen for a week to get community service hours for school. It was the standard cook food, sweep the floors, and wash dishes kind of community service, no big deal. After a few days you begin to see patterns in certain people. Some of who were on their last leg trying to get something to eat, very sad, and some who wasn’t homeless at all and just looking for a handout, very annoying...

On one of the days Mellow Mushroom donated a bunch of pizza they couldn’t sell. For lunch that day everyone got a water and 2 slices of pizza. The rules are that everyone gets their first round of food, and IF there is any left over we announce that you can get a second round. 

So there is the one guy, who clearly wasn’t homeless, coming in everyday to get food, not a problem I guess, until he goes and get his second before anyone else. I politely told him he has to wait until everyone got their first round. Once everyone did, he was the first person to get his seconds. 

Upon cutting to the front of the line, he asks me if we had any pepperoni pizza. I politely tell him that we just ran out and that there was a bunch of others he could have. 

THIS DUDE LOOKS ME DEAD IN THE EYES AND SAYS “MAN Y’ALL MUHH FUCKERS NEVER HAVE PEPPERONI!”

It was the standard cook food, sweep the floors, and wash dishes kind of community service, no big deal. After a few days you begin to see patterns in certain people.

On one of the days Mellow Mushroom donated a bunch of pizza they couldn’t sell. For lunch that day everyone got a water and 2 slices of pizza. The rules are that everyone gets their first round of food, and IF there is any left over we announce that you can get a second round. 

So there is the one guy, who clearly wasn’t homeless, coming in everyday to get food, not a problem I guess, until he goes and get his second before anyone else. I politely told him he has to wait until everyone got their first round. Once everyone did, he was the first person to get his seconds.

"Disclaimer: This story starts a decade ago but concludes 3 years ago.

Every guy has *that friend*, you know the one I'm talking about. The friend that when some unfortunate future partner hears a story that begins with ""One time *friend* and I..."" they tune out because the story is going to involve a lack of maturity, something gross, or the police. 

Tiberius was that friend to me and I was that friend to him. That wasn't his real name of course but it sounds cool. Between the two of us we managed to fill my house with exploded hotdog chunks, his house with smoke bomb smoke and both houses with the stench of shits we took but didn't flush while the other family was on vacation. I mean we were the worst. The only reason our parents didn't ban the other from visiting was we didn't drink alcohol and didn't smoke pot so they figured despite the meat pranks(he once left a pound of meat on the counter while we where on vacation) and my obsession with swapping out their real eggs with ones I had filled with peanut butter they figured it could be worse so they let us be.

One day I went to Tiberious' house, I was 19 he was still a senior in high school , since I was homeschooled in a rural area with no car my being graduated just meant I had to find someplace else to crank one out all day because home was not a hang out for adults and jobs were not plentiful in that community at the time. I got to his house intending to make some shitty flash videos on his much nicer computer, expecting to have several hours of time to myself to make absurd comics.  He was passed out from a hard night of Halo 1 and Mountain Dew butt chugs. He frequently missed entire days of school because of this. 

This was a moment that would define the next several years of my life. I saw a canning jar on his desk and a mcdonalds meal from the night before and the realization came to me the way I imagine the naked guy in the bathtub realized his ass had mass. I grabbed the food and some mushy milk in a cup that was also there and dumped it in the jar. Then I threw in some paintballs that happened to be on the desk as well and sealed it up. 

I climbed a ladder and put it in the attic above his room where he wouldn't find it and forgot about it.

*SIX MONTHS LATER*

Tiberius discovers weed and tries to hide in his attic to get high, blowing out the little tiny window up there that we later learned during the winter if the wind was coming from the right direction blew right into his grandmother's room. She couldn't talk though so she couldn't narc. I still remember the picture text arriving on my Razr while working a landscaping job I had picked up. It was a photo of a jar filled with pure corruption with a bulging top and dried drizzle down the side. Then a question mark.

I explained what happened and we had a good laugh. That was our kind of BS. The next time I was over we made 2 or 3 with the intention of putting them in someone else's house during a house party where we knew they'd get broken. 

We did this every few months when we got bored but never actually used them. This went on for 3 years. Finally his parents wanted to use the attic and we had to move them lest we be caught. We put the twenty or so jars in the garage on a shelf way in the back where surely they would never be found. A few months later he moved out.

*NINE YEARS LATER*

I get this voicemail from Tiberius that is almost 100% incoherent laughter. His father had passed away the year before and they were finally downsizing his mom into a new home. They had been cleaning out the old one when his uncle found the jars on the shelf and before Tiberius could say anything opened one out of curiosity. 

His words ""It's like my body went from normal to ""this is the end, make the cleanup for your family easier, it's bad enough as it is, just accept this, lay down and I'll shut this shit down in peace."" He could not puke the smell was so bad but his uncle barfed bigly dropping the jar. His uncle tried to avoid the splash and knocked a second jar off the shelf which splattered on the floor and the wall making the stench even worse.

His mother had an absolute fucking cow until she learned it was something we did together. It didn't involve alcohol or drugs so aside from a broken blood vessel in her eye from the stress she got over it. Little did she know at the time they discovered this Tiberius and I had been meeting to get baked and watch Pokemon at least once a week since the day he first discovered the original 6 Month Jar.

TL;DR A buddy and I used to make jars of food that we would seal up then open to see how gross they were after about 6 months(6 month jars is what they were called) and we forgot a ton of them in his parent's house. They found them a decade later while cleaning out the house and his uncle opened one, broke another.",272,1527978372.0,8o0uvi,False,"Disclaimer: This story starts a decade ago but concludes 3 years ago.

So, I just finished work at my current place of work, I'll avoid names of the store as I also post on talesfromretail so I don't wish to give to much information away, but this might be hard as people who know the stores and the ""believed"" backstory will know what stores I'm talking about.

Anyhow, after work I went to store B, this set of stores pretty much work the same way as my current place of employment, normally holding the same layout, items, work mechanics etc. Yet, I headed to this ""rival"" store as they currently had a nice helmet cam on sale which I wanted to pick up in case I ever got into any accidents in my bike and needed proof of the incident. 

I was still in my work clothes as I made my way to the bulk and tech section of the store, browsing other goods they had in the area minding my own business. Until I heard a man speak out. He will be... Disbelieving Gent, or, DG.

As he was right next to me, I turned around most likely with a dumbfounded expression.

Me ""Huh?""

DG ""Yes you do, I just need X item. Just see if it's out back""

Me ""No, I can't... And again, I don't work here, I work at ""A"" store"" whilst pointing to my logo on the shirt.

DG ""I know, and i know the stores are owned by brothers, just different names. So don't give me that.""

Now, part of me was amused. The rumour is that both stores are owned by different brothers and people seem to believe this rumour that it's a joint owned corporation and the staff are trained in the same way, and the ""name"" of the store means nothing.

Me ""No... I mean yeah, I know the rumour of the stores, but they are both different companies. So no, I don't work here...""

I think this was the end of it before lo and behold be comes back with the Manager, DG gives the idiotic rant of ""Yeah, this employee won't help me get something out back."" Only for the Manager to look at me, sigh, and explain to DG that I worked for a rival store and that the ""brother joint owning"" rumour was as false as the British weather forecasts. 

DG just sighs again, walks off muttering and that was the end if it.

But hey, I got myself the helmet cam, so, all is good!

"Hi Everyone,

I am currently a department/programs manager at a relatively large non\-profit organization. As part of my day\-to\-day, I perform a handful of HR related tasks \(recruiting/interviewing/hiring/training, performance assessment/corrective action/termination, employee relations etc.\), and I realize that this aspect is what I enjoy the most about my job. As such, I was looking to make a career switch into a more HR focused position.

I found an HR Coordinator position for a smaller, private university in a large city. Most of the job responsibilities listed on the description are tasks I already oversee as a manager, or tasks that I am confident I can pick up on fairly quickly. This seems like a great opportunity to get my foot in the door, and also seems like a position that I would enjoy in general.

The only concern is, in the job description is states ""Send resume and cover letter, including salary expectations"".  I'm really not sure what the right move would be as I've never been asked to include my salary expectations in the opening email... Google \(glassdoor, indeed, etc.\) indicates that the ""average"" HR Coordinator salary in my city can be anywhere from \~41k to \~48k.

I currently make \~50k at my current position. I am willing to take a paycut, but if possible I'd rather not go down too much. I also saw a review on Glassdoor from a former HR Coordinator of this company, reporting that this was a great work environment, but that the pay was on the lower side...

I know I shouldn't be thinking too far into it, since I don't even have an interview. I'm OK taking a slight paycut to get my foot in the door, but I also don't want to be in a position where they won't even consider me for the position because I try to high ball them when other candidates with as much relevant experience as I will do the job for less.

I really would appreciate any guidance on what to put in my email/cover letter regarding the ""salary expectations"" portion of the query. I was thinking something like \- ""Given the combination of my experience and the general average of the HR Coordinator salary, my initial expectations would be in the range of \~45k \- $50k. I am flexible and happy to negotiate this range, upon considering the average HR Coordinator salary at your company as well as the specifics of included employee benefits.""",458,1527974729.0,8o0irb,False,"Hi Everyone,

"I've decided to write this piece of advice for people new to the IT world or those that want to make their way in after noticing a pattern that emerged during the interviews I've held.

This might be quite controversial, but I don't mind downvotes if this post manages to help at least one person get their goals right. Also, English is not my native language, so I might have made a few mistakes here and there.

So \- during the interviews, the most common causes for rejection were:  
\- not knowing their programming language well

\- getting into frameworks before learning basic stuff well

\- not knowing how your tools like git work

\- not being cool about not knowing something

I'm going to break this down into sections by the cause.

**Not knowing your programming language well**

You see, most people do fine when you ask them to write a simple class or something that passes a given set of unit tests \- at the point of applying for IT positions, it's kind of expected. The problem is, programmers often stop learning about their language after going through an initial set of tutorials and the only time they actually learn something new, is when they stumble upon a serious bug that is not obvious from the first look.

Knowing how your language approaches some built\-in data structures, how it handles OOP \(is it classical OOP or prototype\-based one? What are the advantages and disadvantages?\) etc. makes you write more efficient code and allows you to fear writing not\-so\-common code with less fear. We've all had to do some dirty hacks, but you better know how they work, or you are in for hell of a ride there.

How is this important from a tech interviewer's point of view? It lets them see that you know your shit and you will be at least a bit independent/self\-reliant in your work and that others will be able to rely on you as well.

**Getting into frameworks before learning basic stuff well**

We all know that frameworks are awesome. Tons of out\-of\-the\-box tools that you'd otherwise spend weeks working on, just to implement stuff that's considered basic nowadays. The important thing about frameworks that's often overlooked by beginners is that they are based on some design patterns which is the primary reason why they are easily extensible and usable.

We've all been tempted to jump into a new language and after a few hours, try out some most popular frameworks just to get a feel of how all this works and to skip all the grunt work and get some results finally \- this is the easy way. Not knowing how your tools are built will make it way harder to learn them and to maybe extend them with some kind of custom module later. It will slow you down, make your debugging sessions harder and make them occur more often.

This is often checked during tech interviews \- do you know how, why and when to use frameworks or do you just know how to use them to write code for the most common problems? Knowing this will make you a more confident and mature programmer \- you will be able to develop larger applications that you and your colleagues won't hate working on in a few months.

**Not knowing how tools like git work**

This is a bit of a continuation of the previous point. It doesn't just apply to frameworks \- it also applies to basic tools that you use. Do you know how your database of choice works and how it is built? Do you know how git stores your commits and what happens to the graph when you run some commands?

Tools are often seen as some kind of magical boxes that accept commands \(or provide a shiny GUI that runs them for us\) and spew out results that we more or less expect. Knowing what's inside the box lets you be more confident with your interactions with the given tool. No more being scared when you have to do a few complex merges or rebases \- you will know how to safely revert your actions without running for help.

**Not being cool about not knowing something**

Well, let's admit it \- we'll all encounter a situation that we won't know how to go about. Some people stop dead in their tracks and are unable to go any further, some will attempt to hide the fact that they don't know what's happening and some will tell their colleagues that they don't know what to do after some time of troubleshooting and ask for help.

Obviously, it's best to admit your shortcomings and work in a group to resolve them and learn in the process. Of course, not before trying to tackle the problem on your own. Lots of intern developers I've encountered tended to ask questions each few minutes, because they didn't know something. In my experience, those who achieved the best results tried to tackle the problem on their own for some time and when they noticed that they just couldn't go any further, they asked for help and they weren't shy about it.

It's not only about programming problems \- handling any kind of problems the right way is a very important skill in all organisations. People won't have the time to ask you how you are doing every 30 minutes \- it's up to you to decide when you can't handle something on your own and when to escalate the problem higher \- just don't try to be a superhero all the time, because programming projects are most often group work.

**Recap**

During the interviews I've held, people who avoided the problems listed above usually had a blast and it felt more like a regular kitchen conversation than a job interview. Of course, you aren't going to be the best programmer ever from the get go \- it's a process, but it's up to you to keep the order of your development and your goals right.

Let me know what you think about this \- maybe you have a different opinion on this topic and I'll learn something from you as well.

"This happened about 10yrs ago in my Army days during a deployment. I was in a scout platoon (19D) and we had been tasked to set up a screen line on a long empty stretch of road on the outskirts of a town where a task force operation was going on. Essentially we were sitting in place intercepting anyone fleeing from the town for an operation lasting days, so it got incredibly boring, incredibly fast. We did what we could to keep ourselves entertained, while still trying to stay vigilant and not get complacent. Pretty delicate balancing act.     

Now our platoon sergeant (SFC) had a tendency to be bipolar, switching back and forth from unyielding hard-ass dickbag, to happy, friendly, and just goofy AF. This made him generally unpleasant to deal with at any given point in time, as both extremes of his personality were very annoying. So to set the scene, we have been sitting in our humvees in one spot stretched along the road, waiting and watching diligently for 3 days.

I was the Lieutenant's (LT) gunner, and we were passing time as best we could, talking, eating, listening to music on tiny speakers, etc, when the platoon sergeant got bored and started playing on the radio(on our platoon freq, which is only monitored by us). Over the course of hours, he would radio our truck to talk to the LT, just to be silly and pass the time. (apparently his truck had got tired of talking to him, and he was bored) So for hours we hear shit like,  
SFC - ""Hey Red 1(LT's callsign), this is Red 4, over (SFC's callsign)""  
LT - ""4 this is 1, what's up, over""  
SFC - ""Whatcha thinkin bout?""  
  


After a few hours of this type of nonsense, my LT is annoyed beyond measure, and stops answering the radio for him. This only encourages the SFC to spam platoon freq even more.  Finally the LT looks at me and says 'you answer that shit, I'm sick of dealing with his bullshit.' Haha, NO PROBLEM SIR.

If you've been deployed, you know that bootleg music and movies are the main way you stay entertained, and I probably had close to every song known to man downloaded on my Ipod at that point, including random things like slow jazz, classical, and other assorted elevator type music. So I grab the radio, and in my best automated voice impression I say

I was in a scout platoon (19D) and we had been tasked to set up a screen line on a long empty stretch of road on the outskirts of a town where a task force operation was going on. Essentially we were sitting in place intercepting anyone fleeing from the town for an operation lasting days, so it got incredibly boring, incredibly fast. We did what we could to keep ourselves entertained, while still trying to stay vigilant and not get complacent. Pretty delicate balancing act.     

Now our platoon sergeant (SFC) had a tendency to be bipolar, switching back and forth from unyielding hard-ass dickbag, to happy, friendly, and just goofy AF. This made him generally unpleasant to deal with at any given point in time, as both extremes of his personality were very annoying. So to set the scene, we have been sitting in our humvees in one spot stretched along the road, waiting and watching diligently for 3 days.

I was the Lieutenant's (LT) gunner, and we were passing time as best we could, talking, eating, listening to music on tiny speakers, etc, when the platoon sergeant got bored and started playing on the radio(on our platoon freq, which is only monitored by us). Over the course of hours, he would radio our truck to talk to the LT, just to be silly and pass the time. (apparently his truck had got tired of talking to him, and he was bored) So for hours we hear shit like,  
SFC - ""Hey Red 1(LT's callsign), this is Red 4, over (SFC's callsign)""  
LT - ""4 this is 1, what's up, over""  
SFC - ""Whatcha thinkin bout?""  
  


After a few hours of this type of nonsense, my LT is annoyed beyond measure, and stops answering the radio for him. This only encourages the SFC to spam platoon freq even more.  Finally the LT looks at me and says 'you answer that shit, I'm sick of dealing with his bullshit.' Haha, NO PROBLEM SIR.

Why Monday? There are no NBA games, so we can have all the media coverage. There won't be much else to talk about. If we're annoying enough, maybe that Silver (the worm) will even agree to fire BC to make the story go away.

The plan:

I'll arrive at Sixers HQ around 7:30 am. The address is 67 S Front St. Camden, NJ 08103

Here's where I'll be:
https://imgur.com/a/fFxIVjB

I'll be there until he's fired (all day if needed). I've got a bunch of beer ready as well (https://imgur.com/a/BcKhdL4).

Why should you come? This is your chance to truly make an impact. Just image in the future you're sitting with your grandchildren. You can tell them the story of how you got BC fired, which led to (insert GM name) being hired. This got LeBron to Philly, and thus the sixers won the championship in 2019. This is a greater impact than any other fan has ever had on a professional sports team ever. You can really help the sixers win the NBA finals next year! If that's not worth a vacation/sick day, I don't know what is! If your boss won't give you the day off, tell him to find a new slant! If we're successful, we might even end up on game of zones!

If you can't come all day, come before work or during your lunch break or after work. We'll be there until he's fired.

How can you help?

* Show up! Bring signs and beer!
* Tweet/Facebook/Myspace about it. Let everyone know.
* Tell your friends, family, and enemies. Doesn't matter who they are, as long as they show up, they're helping.
* Call WIP/97.5/other radio stations and let them know
* Contact TV news and reporters. The more coverage we get, the sooner they'll make it all go away

This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be part of a great moment in Philly history! I really think we can get a few hundred or maybe even thousand people to show up to this. If we do, not only will it be fun, it will be effective. This is a chance to show the world that there is no city as passionate as Philly. We can show every NBA player what how much we care. This may even help convince LeBron he wants to play here, cause there's nothing like Philly!

I hope to see you all Monday morning! Fuck Bryan, Collars, Silver, Celtics, Dallas and Pens! And always Trust the Process!

I hope to see you all Monday morning! Fuck Bryan, Collars, Silver, Celtics, Dallas and Pens! And always Trust the Process!
",0,"The response to the idea of a protest (https://www.reddit.com/r/sixers/comments/8nwira/if_bc_hasnt_been_fired_by_monday_morning_whos/) was quite positive. Seeing as BC has yet to be fired, it is time to take matters into our own hands. Monday morning we protest!


Why Monday? There are no NBA games, so we can have all the media coverage. There won't be much else to talk about. If we're annoying enough, maybe that Silver (the worm) will even agree to fire BC to make the story go away.

The plan:

I'll arrive at Sixers HQ around 7:30 am. The address is 67 S Front St. Camden, NJ 08103

Here's where I'll be:
https://imgur.com/a/fFxIVjB

I'll be there until he's fired (all day if needed). I've got a bunch of beer ready as well (https://imgur.com/a/BcKhdL4).

Why should you come? This is your chance to truly make an impact. Just image in the future you're sitting with your grandchildren. You can tell them the story of how you got BC fired, which led to (insert GM name) being hired. This got LeBron to Philly, and thus the sixers won the championship in 2019. This is a greater impact than any other fan has ever had on a professional sports team ever. You can really help the sixers win the NBA finals next year! If that's not worth a vacation/sick day, I don't know what is! If your boss won't give you the day off, tell him to find a new slant! If we're successful, we might even end up on game of zones!

If you can't come all day, come before work or during your lunch break or after work. We'll be there until he's fired.

How can you help?

* Show up! Bring signs and beer!
* Tweet/Facebook/Myspace about it. Let everyone know.
* Tell your friends, family, and enemies. Doesn't matter who they are, as long as they show up, they're helping.
* Call WIP/97.5/other radio stations and let them know
* Contact TV news and reporters. The more coverage we get, the sooner they'll make it all go away

This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be part of a great moment in Philly history! I really think we can get a few hundred or maybe even thousand people to show up to this. If we do, not only will it be fun, it will be effective. This is a chance to show the world that there is no city as passionate as Philly. We can show every NBA player what how much we care. This may even help convince LeBron he wants to play here, cause there's nothing like Philly!

I hope to see you all Monday morning! Fuck Bryan, Collars, Silver, Celtics, Dallas and Pens! And always Trust the Process!

"Over ten years ago, I was part of a small writers’ group where we agreed to offer honest feedback to each other. Of the eight of us or so, one of us was published. It was a really valuable time of growth and painful critique. We were always excited to meet, and I have fond memories of the first few months we met at Borders bookstore. 

However, I lacked the self-awareness and seriousness to really contribute to the group. I didn’t read each member’s excerpts on time. I showed up late frequently. I was afraid of incorporating the suggested changes. I was outwardly agreeable but inwardly defensive. This is all obvious to me now—perhaps obvious to any reasonable person looking in—and I’d like to blame youth on my obliviousness, but I’m certain it was my inflated ego. 

Eventually I stopped getting the emails to meet up. I was never formally disinvited so I figured they had simply stopped meeting. But a few months after the last email, I was invited again. I showed up with a couple chapters of a book I was working on, ready to engage seriously with the group this time. I found out very slowly through social cues that the group leader accidentally CC’ed me into the email. Even though I tried my best to approach with a new attitude, I was never invited again, accidentally or otherwise. It was, of course, a completely understandable move on their part. 

I write all this in hopes you may take away from my mistakes. That 1) it is painful to hear criticism but so necessary for growth, and 2) having a group of similarly passionate people is a wonderful experience that money can’t buy. I have only good memories of my time with the group. I’m still mad at myself for squandering the opportunity.

"*Disclaimer: Honeypots, while a very cool project, are literally painting a bullseye on yourself. If you don't know what you're doing and how to secure it, I'd strongly recommend against trying to build one if is exposed to the internet.*

**So what is a honeypot?**

Honeypots are simply vulnerable servers built to be compromised, with the intention of gathering information about the attackers. In the case of [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/8nycon/some_cools_stats_from_my_honeypot/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=homelab), I was showing off the stats of an SSH honeypot, but you can setup web servers/database servers/whatever you'd like. You can even use Netcat to open a listening port to see who tries to connect. 

While you can gather some information based on authentication logs, they still don't fully give us what we want. I initially wrote myself a Python script that would crawl my auth/secure.log and give stats on the IP and username attempts for my SSH jump host that I had open to the internet. It would use GeoIP to get the location from the IP address and get counts for usernames tried as well. 

This was great, for what it was, but it didn't give me any information about the passwords being tried. Moreover, if anybody ever did gain access to a system, we'd like to see what they try to do once they're in. Honeypots are the answer to that.

**Why do we care?**

For plenty of people, we probably don't care about this info. It's easiest to just setup your firewall to block everything that isn't needed and call it a day. As for me, I'm a network engineer at a university, who is also involved with the cyber defense club on campus. So between my own personal desire for the project, it's also a great way to show the students real live data on attacks coming in. Knowing what attackers may try to do, if they gain unauthorized access, will help them better defend systems. 

It can be nice to have something like this setup internally as well - you never know if housemates/coworkers are trying to access systems that they shouldn't.

**Cowrie - an SSH Honeypot**

The honeypot used is [Cowrie](https://github.com/micheloosterhof/cowrie), a well known SSH honeypot based on the older Kippo. It records username/password attempts, but also lets you set combinations that actually work. If the attacker gets one of those attempts correct, they're presented with what seems to be a Linux server.  However, this is actually a small emulated version of Linux that records all commands run and allows an attacker to think they've breached a system. Mostly, I've seen a bunch of the same commands pasted in, as plenty of these attacks are automated bots. 

If you haven't done anything with honeypots before, I'd recommend trying this out - just don't open it to the internet. Practice trying to gain access to it and where to find everything in the logs.
All of this data is sent to both text logs and JSON formatted logs. Similar to my authentication logs, I initially wrote a Python script to crawl the logs and give me top username/password/IP addresses. Since the data is also in JSON format, using something like an ELK stack is very possible, in order to get the data better visualized. I didn't really want to have too many holes open from the honeypot to access my ELK stack and would prefer everything to be self contained. Enter Tpot...

**T-Pot**

[T-Pot](https://github.com/dtag-dev-sec/tpotce) is fantastic - it has several honeypots built in, running as Docker containers, and an ELK Stack to visualize all the data it is given. You can create an ISO image for it, but I opted to go with the [auto-install method](https://github.com/dtag-dev-sec/t-pot-autoinstall) on an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server. The server is a VM on my ESXi box on it's own VLAN (I'll get to that in a bit). I gave it 128GB HDD, 2 CPUs and 4 GB RAM, which seems to have been running fine so far. The recommended is 8GB RAM, so do as you feel is appropriate for you. I encrypted the drive and the home directory, just in case. I then cloned the auto-install scripts and ran through the process. As with all scripts that you download, please please go through it before you run it to make sure nothing terrible is happening. But the script requires you to run it as the root user, so assume this machine is hostile from the start and segment appropriately. The installer itself is pretty straightforward, the biggest thing is the choice of installation: 

* Standard - the honeypots, Suricata, and ELK
* Honeypot Only - Just the honeypots, no Suricata, and ELK
* Industrial - Conpot, eMobility, Suricata, and ELK. Conpot is a honeypot for Industrial Control Systems
* Full - Everything

I opted to go for the Standard install. It will change the SSH port for you to log into it, as needed. You'll mostly view everything through Kibana though, once it's all setup. As soon as the install is complete, you should be good to go. If you have any issues with it, check out the Github page and open an Issue if needed.

**Setting up the VLAN, Firewall, and NAT Destination Rules**

Now it's time to start getting some actual data to the honeypot. The easiest thing would be to just open up SSH to the world via port forwarding and point it at the honeypot. I wanted to do something slightly more complex. I already have a hardened SSH jump host exposed and I didn't want to change the SSH port for it. I also wanted to make sure that the honeypot was in a secured VLAN so it couldn't access any internal resources.

I run an Edgerouter Lite, making all of this pretty easily done. First, I created the VLAN on the router dashboard (Add Interface -> Add VLAN). I trunked that VLAN to my ESXi host, made a new port group and placed the honeypot in that segment. Next, we need to setup the firewall rules for that VLAN.

In the Edgerouter's Firewall Policies, I created a new Ruleset ""LAN_TO_HONEYPOT"". It needs a few rules setup - allow me to access the management and web ports from my internal VLANs (so I can still manage the system and view the data) and also allow port 22 to that VLAN. I don't allow any incoming rules from the honeypot VLAN. Port 22 was already added to my ""WAN_IN"" ruleset, but you'll need to add that rule as well to allow SSH access from the internet. 

Here's generally how the rules are setup:

* https://i.imgur.com/SG7Tb28.png
* https://i.imgur.com/tiM5c1j.png
* https://i.imgur.com/Nbq74L6.png

Since I wanted to still have my jump host running port 22, we can't use traditional port forwarding to solve this - I wanted to set things up in such a way that if I came from certain addresses, I'd get sent to the jump host and everything outside of that address set would get forwarded to the honeypot. This is done pretty simply by using Destination NAT rules. Our first step is to setup the address-group. In the Edgerouter, under Firewall/NAT is the Firewall/NAT Groups tab. I made a new group, ""SSH_Allowed"" and added in the ranges I desired (my work address range, Comcast, a few others). Using this address group makes it easier to add/remove addresses versus trying to track down all the firewall/NAT rules that I added specific addresses to. 

Once the group was created, I then went to the NAT tab and clicked ""Add Destination NAT Rule.""  This can seem a little complex at first, but once you have an idea of what goes where, it makes more sense. I made two rules, one for SSH to my jump host and a second (order matters with these rules) to catch everything else. Here are the two rules I setup:

[SSH to Jumphost](https://i.imgur.com/3Tz2hS3.png)

[Everything else to Honeypot](https://i.imgur.com/yYcL3wx.png)

Replace the ""Dest Address"" with your external IP address in both cases. You should see in the first rule that I use the Source Address Group that I setup previously. 

Once these rules are in place, you're all set. The honeypot is setup and on a segmented VLAN, with only very limited access in, to manage and view it. NAT destination rules are used to allow access to our SSH server, but send everything else to the honeypot itself. Give it about an hour and you'll have plenty of data to work with. Access the honeypot's Kibana page and go to town! 

Let me know what you think of the writeup, I'm happy to cover other topics, if you wish, but I'd love feedback on how informative/technical this was. 

Here's the last 12 hours from the honeypot, for updated info just since my last post:

In the Edgerouter's Firewall Policies, I created a new Ruleset ""LAN_TO_HONEYPOT"". It needs a few rules setup - allow me to access the management and web ports from my internal VLANs (so I can still manage the system and view the data) and also allow port 22 to that VLAN. I don't allow any incoming rules from the honeypot VLAN. Port 22 was already added to my ""WAN_IN"" ruleset, but you'll need to add that rule as well to allow SSH access from the internet. 

Here's generally how the rules are setup:

* https://i.imgur.com/tiM5c1j.png
* https://i.imgur.com/Nbq74L6.png

Since I wanted to still have my jump host running port 22, we can't use traditional port forwarding to solve this - I wanted to set things up in such a way that if I came from certain addresses, I'd get sent to the jump host and everything outside of that address set would get forwarded to the honeypot. This is done pretty simply by using Destination NAT rules. Our first step is to setup the address-group. In the Edgerouter, under Firewall/NAT is the Firewall/NAT Groups tab. I made a new group, ""SSH_Allowed"" and added in the ranges I desired (my work address range, Comcast, a few others). Using this address group makes it easier to add/remove addresses versus trying to track down all the firewall/NAT rules that I added specific addresses to. 

Once the group was created, I then went to the NAT tab and clicked ""Add Destination NAT Rule.""  This can seem a little complex at first, but once you have an idea of what goes where, it makes more sense. I made two rules, one for SSH to my jump host and a second (order matters with these rules) to catch everything else. Here are the two rules I setup:

[SSH to Jumphost](https://i.imgur.com/3Tz2hS3.png)

[Everything else to Honeypot](https://i.imgur.com/yYcL3wx.png)

Replace the ""Dest Address"" with your external IP address in both cases. You should see in the first rule that I use the Source Address Group that I setup previously. 

Once these rules are in place, you're all set. The honeypot is setup and on a segmented VLAN, with only very limited access in, to manage and view it. NAT destination rules are used to allow access to our SSH server, but send everything else to the honeypot itself. Give it about an hour and you'll have plenty of data to work with. Access the honeypot's Kibana page and go to town! 

Let me know what you think of the writeup, I'm happy to cover other topics, if you wish, but I'd love feedback on how informative/technical this was. 

Here's the last 12 hours from the honeypot, for updated info just since my last post:

https://i.imgur.com/oYoSMay.png",0,"*Disclaimer: Honeypots, while a very cool project, are literally painting a bullseye on yourself. If you don't know what you're doing and how to secure it, I'd strongly recommend against trying to build one if is exposed to the internet.*

**So what is a honeypot?**

Honeypots are simply vulnerable servers built to be compromised, with the intention of gathering information about the attackers. In the case of [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/8nycon/some_cools_stats_from_my_honeypot/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=homelab), I was showing off the stats of an SSH honeypot, but you can setup web servers/database servers/whatever you'd like. You can even use Netcat to open a listening port to see who tries to connect. 

While you can gather some information based on authentication logs, they still don't fully give us what we want. I initially wrote myself a Python script that would crawl my auth/secure.log and give stats on the IP and username attempts for my SSH jump host that I had open to the internet. It would use GeoIP to get the location from the IP address and get counts for usernames tried as well. 

This was great, for what it was, but it didn't give me any information about the passwords being tried. Moreover, if anybody ever did gain access to a system, we'd like to see what they try to do once they're in. Honeypots are the answer to that.

**Why do we care?**

For plenty of people, we probably don't care about this info. It's easiest to just setup your firewall to block everything that isn't needed and call it a day. As for me, I'm a network engineer at a university, who is also involved with the cyber defense club on campus. So between my own personal desire for the project, it's also a great way to show the students real live data on attacks coming in. Knowing what attackers may try to do, if they gain unauthorized access, will help them better defend systems. 

It can be nice to have something like this setup internally as well - you never know if housemates/coworkers are trying to access systems that they shouldn't.

**Cowrie - an SSH Honeypot**

The honeypot used is [Cowrie](https://github.com/micheloosterhof/cowrie), a well known SSH honeypot based on the older Kippo. It records username/password attempts, but also lets you set combinations that actually work. If the attacker gets one of those attempts correct, they're presented with what seems to be a Linux server.  However, this is actually a small emulated version of Linux that records all commands run and allows an attacker to think they've breached a system. Mostly, I've seen a bunch of the same commands pasted in, as plenty of these attacks are automated bots. 

If you haven't done anything with honeypots before, I'd recommend trying this out - just don't open it to the internet. Practice trying to gain access to it and where to find everything in the logs.
All of this data is sent to both text logs and JSON formatted logs. Similar to my authentication logs, I initially wrote a Python script to crawl the logs and give me top username/password/IP addresses. Since the data is also in JSON format, using something like an ELK stack is very possible, in order to get the data better visualized. I didn't really want to have too many holes open from the honeypot to access my ELK stack and would prefer everything to be self contained. Enter Tpot...

**T-Pot**

[T-Pot](https://github.com/dtag-dev-sec/tpotce) is fantastic - it has several honeypots built in, running as Docker containers, and an ELK Stack to visualize all the data it is given. You can create an ISO image for it, but I opted to go with the [auto-install method](https://github.com/dtag-dev-sec/t-pot-autoinstall) on an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server. The server is a VM on my ESXi box on it's own VLAN (I'll get to that in a bit). I gave it 128GB HDD, 2 CPUs and 4 GB RAM, which seems to have been running fine so far. The recommended is 8GB RAM, so do as you feel is appropriate for you. I encrypted the drive and the home directory, just in case. I then cloned the auto-install scripts and ran through the process. As with all scripts that you download, please please go through it before you run it to make sure nothing terrible is happening. But the script requires you to run it as the root user, so assume this machine is hostile from the start and segment appropriately. The installer itself is pretty straightforward, the biggest thing is the choice of installation: 

* Standard - the honeypots, Suricata, and ELK
* Honeypot Only - Just the honeypots, no Suricata, and ELK
* Industrial - Conpot, eMobility, Suricata, and ELK. Conpot is a honeypot for Industrial Control Systems
* Full - Everything

I opted to go for the Standard install. It will change the SSH port for you to log into it, as needed. You'll mostly view everything through Kibana though, once it's all setup. As soon as the install is complete, you should be good to go. If you have any issues with it, check out the Github page and open an Issue if needed.

**Setting up the VLAN, Firewall, and NAT Destination Rules**

Now it's time to start getting some actual data to the honeypot. The easiest thing would be to just open up SSH to the world via port forwarding and point it at the honeypot. I wanted to do something slightly more complex. I already have a hardened SSH jump host exposed and I didn't want to change the SSH port for it. I also wanted to make sure that the honeypot was in a secured VLAN so it couldn't access any internal resources.

It needs a few rules setup - allow me to access the management and web ports from my internal VLANs (so I can still manage the system and view the data) and also allow port 22 to that VLAN. I don't allow any incoming rules from the honeypot VLAN. Port 22 was already added to my ""WAN_IN"" ruleset, but you'll need to add that rule as well to allow SSH access from the internet. 

Here's generally how the rules are setup:

* https://i.imgur.com/SG7Tb28.png
* https://i.imgur.com/tiM5c1j.png
* https://i.imgur.com/Nbq74L6.png

Since I wanted to still have my jump host running port 22, we can't use traditional port forwarding to solve this - I wanted to set things up in such a way that if I came from certain addresses, I'd get sent to the jump host and everything outside of that address set would get forwarded to the honeypot. This is done pretty simply by using Destination NAT rules. Our first step is to setup the address-group. In the Edgerouter, under Firewall/NAT is the Firewall/NAT Groups tab. I made a new group, ""SSH_Allowed"" and added in the ranges I desired (my work address range, Comcast, a few others). Using this address group makes it easier to add/remove addresses versus trying to track down all the firewall/NAT rules that I added specific addresses to. 

Once the group was created, I then went to the NAT tab and clicked ""Add Destination NAT Rule.""  This can seem a little complex at first, but once you have an idea of what goes where, it makes more sense. I made two rules, one for SSH to my jump host and a second (order matters with these rules) to catch everything else. Here are the two rules I setup:

[SSH to Jumphost](https://i.imgur.com/3Tz2hS3.png)

[Everything else to Honeypot](https://i.imgur.com/yYcL3wx.png)

Replace the ""Dest Address"" with your external IP address in both cases. You should see in the first rule that I use the Source Address Group that I setup previously. 

Once these rules are in place, you're all set. The honeypot is setup and on a segmented VLAN, with only very limited access in, to manage and view it. NAT destination rules are used to allow access to our SSH server, but send everything else to the honeypot itself. Give it about an hour and you'll have plenty of data to work with. Access the honeypot's Kibana page and go to town! 

Let me know what you think of the writeup, I'm happy to cover other topics, if you wish, but I'd love feedback on how informative/technical this was. 

Here's the last 12 hours from the honeypot, for updated info just since my last post:

https://i.imgur.com/oYoSMay.png",19,1528013489.0,8o4rws,False,"*Disclaimer: Honeypots, while a very cool project, are literally painting a bullseye on yourself. If you don't know what you're doing and how to secure it, I'd strongly recommend against trying to build one if is exposed to the internet.*

**So what is a honeypot?**

Honeypots are simply vulnerable servers built to be compromised, with the intention of gathering information about the attackers. In the case of [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/8nycon/some_cools_stats_from_my_honeypot/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=homelab), I was showing off the stats of an SSH honeypot, but you can setup web servers/database servers/whatever you'd like. You can even use Netcat to open a listening port to see who tries to connect. 

While you can gather some information based on authentication logs, they still don't fully give us what we want. I initially wrote myself a Python script that would crawl my auth/secure.log and give stats on the IP and username attempts for my SSH jump host that I had open to the internet. It would use GeoIP to get the location from the IP address and get counts for usernames tried as well. 

This was great, for what it was, but it didn't give me any information about the passwords being tried. Moreover, if anybody ever did gain access to a system, we'd like to see what they try to do once they're in. Honeypots are the answer to that.

**Why do we care?**

For plenty of people, we probably don't care about this info. It's easiest to just setup your firewall to block everything that isn't needed and call it a day. As for me, I'm a network engineer at a university, who is also involved with the cyber defense club on campus. So between my own personal desire for the project, it's also a great way to show the students real live data on attacks coming in. Knowing what attackers may try to do, if they gain unauthorized access, will help them better defend systems. 

It can be nice to have something like this setup internally as well - you never know if housemates/coworkers are trying to access systems that they shouldn't.

**Cowrie - an SSH Honeypot**

The honeypot used is [Cowrie](https://github.com/micheloosterhof/cowrie), a well known SSH honeypot based on the older Kippo. It records username/password attempts, but also lets you set combinations that actually work. If the attacker gets one of those attempts correct, they're presented with what seems to be a Linux server.  However, this is actually a small emulated version of Linux that records all commands run and allows an attacker to think they've breached a system. Mostly, I've seen a bunch of the same commands pasted in, as plenty of these attacks are automated bots. 

If you haven't done anything with honeypots before, I'd recommend trying this out - just don't open it to the internet. Practice trying to gain access to it and where to find everything in the logs.
All of this data is sent to both text logs and JSON formatted logs. Similar to my authentication logs, I initially wrote a Python script to crawl the logs and give me top username/password/IP addresses. Since the data is also in JSON format, using something like an ELK stack is very possible, in order to get the data better visualized. I didn't really want to have too many holes open from the honeypot to access my ELK stack and would prefer everything to be self contained. Enter Tpot...

**T-Pot**

[T-Pot](https://github.com/dtag-dev-sec/tpotce) is fantastic - it has several honeypots built in, running as Docker containers, and an ELK Stack to visualize all the data it is given. You can create an ISO image for it, but I opted to go with the [auto-install method](https://github.com/dtag-dev-sec/t-pot-autoinstall) on an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server. The server is a VM on my ESXi box on it's own VLAN (I'll get to that in a bit). I gave it 128GB HDD, 2 CPUs and 4 GB RAM, which seems to have been running fine so far. The recommended is 8GB RAM, so do as you feel is appropriate for you. I encrypted the drive and the home directory, just in case. I then cloned the auto-install scripts and ran through the process. As with all scripts that you download, please please go through it before you run it to make sure nothing terrible is happening. But the script requires you to run it as the root user, so assume this machine is hostile from the start and segment appropriately. The installer itself is pretty straightforward, the biggest thing is the choice of installation: 

* Standard - the honeypots, Suricata, and ELK
* Honeypot Only - Just the honeypots, no Suricata, and ELK
* Industrial - Conpot, eMobility, Suricata, and ELK. Conpot is a honeypot for Industrial Control Systems
* Full - Everything

I opted to go for the Standard install. It will change the SSH port for you to log into it, as needed. You'll mostly view everything through Kibana though, once it's all setup. As soon as the install is complete, you should be good to go. If you have any issues with it, check out the Github page and open an Issue if needed.

**Setting up the VLAN, Firewall, and NAT Destination Rules**

Now it's time to start getting some actual data to the honeypot. The easiest thing would be to just open up SSH to the world via port forwarding and point it at the honeypot. I wanted to do something slightly more complex. I already have a hardened SSH jump host exposed and I didn't want to change the SSH port for it. I also wanted to make sure that the honeypot was in a secured VLAN so it couldn't access any internal resources.

I run an Edgerouter Lite, making all of this pretty easily done. First, I created the VLAN on the router dashboard (Add Interface -> Add VLAN). I trunked that VLAN to my ESXi host, made a new port group and placed the honeypot in that segment. Next, we need to setup the firewall rules for that VLAN.

In the Edgerouter's Firewall Policies, I created a new Ruleset ""LAN_TO_HONEYPOT"". It needs a few rules setup - allow me to access the management and web ports from my internal VLANs (so I can still manage the system and view the data) and also allow port 22 to that VLAN. I don't allow any incoming rules from the honeypot VLAN. Port 22 was already added to my ""WAN_IN"" ruleset, but you'll need to add that rule as well to allow SSH access from the internet. 

Here's generally how the rules are setup:

"I’m by no means any sort of handy man. But after being annoyed by some sagging ceiling tiles I climbed in the attic to have a look. Moved some insulation, found the tiles, applied liquid nails to the underside of the board (stud?) running across the attic, and climbed down to press the tiles up into the liquid nails. Realized I couldn’t hold my arms up for 8 hours for this stuff to dry so stuck a kitchen chair on our bed (sagging tiles were directly over) and found some board under the house to prop on the chair and stabilize the tiles. Worked! No more sagging tiles. 

Walking down the attic ladder broke a couple of steps. Figured I could duct tape the steps to hold the splinter pieces of the steps in place, inserted into slots of attic ladder, applied nails (metal, not liquid) Bam! Fixed. 

Figured I was on a roll so why not hang a mirror? Had tried a few weeks ago to use some of those plastic mirror holders. Failed. So I screwed some screws into the wall for a support system, stuck some of this mirror holding epoxy on the mirror. Set mirror on screw stabilizers and pressed to wall. Presto, I’m mother fuckin Bob Villa! Now I’ll have to patch the wall when I take the screws out, but I think a monkey like myself can do that. 

My girlfriend sees this and is impressed as she should be! No blood. No broken bones. No deaths. Just a sprained pinkie toe from falling off the attic step while it’s breaking. She has a second, older model car that shifts into gear but won’t engage the transmission. I think it’s a broken linkage system and she’s sure I can fix it.... but let’s not get ahead of our selves just yet, babe.

"I've been a lurker on this sub for a long time, and I love reading everyone's stories about how they got on their FIRE path, so I thought I would share my own, even though my net worth is pretty moderate by many standards.

I am 31 years old, and have just made it to my first $100,000.

I grew up with great parents, but from early on I could see how debt affected their lives.  My mom had a six figure job and my dad mostly didn't work.  Mom supported Dad financially, especially his gambling habits, which took a big chunk out of any hopes for retirement she had.  Mom is now 64 and still working full time.  The law firm that she dedicated 30 years of her life to fired her during the 2009 recession.  Mom never paid off the house, instead taking out a second mortgage after she got canned.  In short, my parents have always spent any money they earned rather than saving it.

I was able to go to college for free due to scholarships and some financial help from my grandma.  I worked at the financial aid office as a work study during my time there.  Every day I would watch 18 year olds sign their lives away for unsubsidized student loans.  Most kids didn't even want to know the difference between subsidized or unsubsidized; they only wanted to know how much they qualified for.  I made excellent grades and made it out of college debt free, but with a useless Bachelor of Science in Religious Studies.  Not a great choice on my part, but live and learn.  My first full time job after I graduated was as a cashier at a grocery store.  I abhored every minute of it.  The plan after graduating was to teach English overseas, but by this time, I was married to a man I had met while in college. He had been going to classes for seven years and still hadn't graduated.

My husband worked at a local video game store owned by our friend who was having to file bankruptcy.  By combining our life savings, money I had inherited from my grandpa, and two loans we took out from my grandma and his grandma, we bought the video game store.  We really turned that place around, and we worked our asses off to pay back our loans.  After just six months of ownership, our business was in the black.  For the first time in our lives, we were making real money, and it felt amazing.  We found a great deal on a house and paid for it in cash.  By 27 years old, I had done what my parents could not: paid off the house.  It felt great.

Even though finances were good, managing the businesses weighed heavy on our marriage.  We even opened up two more stores.  But the stress combined with our own personal problems swelled and blew up in our faces.  We divorced, and my husband took the house and the businesses.  I took $50,000 and put it in mutual funds then went on a six month long hike.  This was first time since I was 17 years old that I didn't have a job.  The feeling of having a basically six month vacation was intoxicating.  Try it: it will ruin you to figure out how to retire as soon as possible.  The hike also taught me that I don't need much at all materially to be happy.  Just living with what I could carry in my backpack was plenty enough to make me content.

Since the hike, I have been living a much different life than when I owned the businesses.  My jobs have been low stress and low pay, but the money I put into investments has grown to $80,000.  On top of that, my grandma left me an inheritance of $20,000.  So, sooner than I expected, I have no debt and a net worth of $100,000.  My grandma made most of her money through real estate, and I have thought about buying another fixer upper in cash, both as an investment and a way of honoring her.  Even if I don't, I will continue to reinvest my capital gains and dividends.  

Anyway, I don't talk to my family or friends about how much money I have, and it felt good writing it all down.  Thanks everybody and best wishes on your endeavors.  I admire you people!

"So, I recently finished my first real, long-term D&D campaign.  It ran for five years and ~70 “episodes”) (with some hiatuses), both in-person and over Roll20, was entirely homebrew, took players from level 1 to level 14, and honestly is probably one of the bigger creative accomplishments of my life.  I’ve been reflecting on the experience of DMing a campaign like this and what I’ve learned from it, and wanted to share a few of the more important lessons that I’ll take into my next DMing gig.  Broadly, I found that the three big axes around which I could “optimize” the health of my game were: “player agency,” “campaign fidelity,” and “DM sanity.”  I didn’t explicitly call these categories out below for the most part, but this tri-axis system really came to inform a lot of what I did and how I learned from my experiences, so I thought I’d mention it.

For context, I basically started DMing in earnest at the start of the D&D Next Playtest (Summer 2012) and started this campaign in Summer 2013. So, still pretty green when I started, but hey, it worked out!  I know everyone hates those self-indulgent “LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY CAMPAIGN!!!” stories, so I’ve tried to keep examples from being overly frilly – of course, I’m happy to go into detail on any stories that would be helpful, but wanted to keep the lessons themselves as the focus, not my campaign.  I also don’t really like it when DMs present their own experiences as universally applicable and treat their advice as imperative, so I’ve tried hard to make it clear these lessons were meaningful to ME personally -- I hope they are also meaningful to you but I understand that everyone’s DM style and needs are different.  Anyway, without further ado, here they are:

----------

The single most important lesson I learned is to be flexible. One way to do that is to treat your story more like a TV show than a novel.
----------

I once heard the writers of a network TV show talk about how they went about planning and writing their story.  They started with the central premise and a strong idea of where they wanted to start and end.  They had a well-defined concept of the WHAT of their story (say, “The Story We Want To Tell”)  BUT, they also recognized that the WHAT (“The Story We Want To Tell”) wasn’t synonymous with the HOW (“The Way We Tell Our Story”)  They were ready to write characters out entirely, extend or compact seasons, divert storylines, and so on, because TV is episodic and subject to the whims of the network, audience, actors, etc.  Contrast that to novels, where the author literally has absolute control over both The Story They Want To Tell and The Way They Tell Their Story. Both of those conceptions work to perfectly craft exactly the right narrative, told in exactly the right way.  This great power helps the novelist make the story As Good As Possible, but it’s just not a power available to TV showmakers – or DMs writing their own campaign.
 
For my campaign, the premise was “what if the PCs lived in one of multiple parallel worlds created by the gods at different levels of ‘entropy’?” I built the whole story from that question.  I had a strong idea of how I’d start the story, how the PCs would discover the multiple worlds, and how the story would end.  BUT I didn’t know which of my players would stay or leave.  I didn’t know which NPCs would become important or not.  I didn’t know which hooks players would explore or ignore.  **Treating my story less like a novel and more like a TV show, with a strong idea of What Story I Wanted To Tell but flexibility in How I Told My Story, enabled the campaign to progress organically, meeting both my goals and the players’ needs throughout each arc, all the way to the end.** In fact, I literally broke my campaign into “seasons” and treated sessions as discrete “episodes” leading to “season finales,” etc.  It helped my organization and my mindset tremendously, provided natural break points and places for players to step away or join the campaign, and so on.  I really cannot recommend being flexible in this way enough.
 
Flexibility and Planning Are Two Sides of the Same Creative Coin
------

I’ve seen a lot of DMs online talk about the importance of developing “improv” as a skill.  Personally I suck pretty badly at improv.  And to be honest I don’t think Online DMs really understand what they are saying when they suggest this.  Usually it’s framed as “your games will go better if you’re good at improv and don’t force your session to rigidly conform to your plan!” But, strictly speaking, improv is the practiced performance skill of creating a compelling performance from unscripted/unplanned material, not simply the ability to successfully -- and _flexibly_ -- implement a plan in adverse conditions without clinging dogmatically to a crystallized set of rules.  Improv, defined as above, _can_ be a useful skill for DMs, but _by definition,_ it eschews planning in favor of adaptation, so the ability to implement long-term narrative structures such as foreshadowing is limited to the scope of the improv itself, since nothing outside of the improv’s unplanned material can be brought in. There’s nothing wrong with that! **But I think it’s entirely possible to be flexible and adapt, allowing your players to exhibit agency and be creative -- all while still planning and plotting to your heart’s content.**
 
For me, I found that my ability to contingency-plan and create organized story structures (within the framework described above) made it easier to be flexible in those moments when my players deviated from my “ideal” path.  It didn’t mean I had to abandon my plans or come up with content on the fly.  It just meant I had to use observation and analysis skills to read the situation and decide which set pieces to play or delay, when to pivot, etc. **I had enough contingency plans that instead of “improving,” I was able to be flexible by choosing from several options I had already thought about.**  This reduced my in-game stress considerably, because I honestly do suck at coming up with things on the fly most of the time.  And look, just to be clear, there will always be that one session where you didn’t have time to prep, or you weren’t able to predict your players’ latest weird obsession.  Improving a fun session or two when you need to is a good skill to have, if only so the fun doesn’t stop.  But what I’m saying is that I found smart, rigorous pre-planning a more “flexible” option than resigning myself to making things up as I went – and I don’t think it’s necessary to take that path if you don’t want to.
 

You Can Have It All: “Railroad vs. Sandbox” Is (Sometimes) a False Dichotomy.
-----

 I’m not here to start a big argument about “narrative” or “sandbox” games or whatever.  It’s my personal opinion that when most people talk about wanting their game to be a “sandbox,” what they really mean is that they want player choices to feel like they matter. 

 I think that (most!) D&D players don’t want to play Wizard Minecraft, walking through a world that does nothing until they interact with it and even then only reacting in kind.  I think most players _do_ want some (or even a lot of) narrative direction, some incentive to take actions, and some risks for their choices.  When people say they don’t want to get railroaded, what I think they mean is that they don’t want to feel like they’re NPCs in the DM’s little private novella. They want their choices to matter.  And I think that players (and some DMs) have picked up on this and operationalized the word “sandbox” to capture these feelings, even though IMO it’s a term not well designed for the usage.  And in the meantime, words like “linear,” “narrative-focused,” etc. have become dirty words.
 
**But I think you can have a well-designed, narratively-rich game that builds a linearly progressive story and delivers on things like foreshadowing and character development while still making your players’ choices have real consequences.**  A linear story doesn’t _require_ your players to feel railroaded. One thing that helped me was making sure that the players always knew that there was more going wrong in the world than they could fix with a single choice. This meant that _every_ big choice they made carried _some_ consequence, and gave them a sense of agency from square one.  I also learned that there were subtle ways to present players with multiple options such that one option was more appealing and players were more likely to pick it.  I also learned to use “magician’s choice” well, giving players more of the illusion of choice than an actual choice, which sounds like a cheat but, honestly, it got the job done for players experiencing a sense of agency, which is what they wanted.  **These tools allowed me to tell The Story I Wanted To Tell while still letting players have their agency in The Way The Story Was Told, keeping them from feeling railroaded and making it smoother for everyone.**
 

Your Players Are Authors Too.
--------

This flows pretty naturally from the immediately prior lesson I think a lot of DMs are scared to let their players have too much agency because they don't want their well-laid plans to go awry.  That's understandable, but I found that my players needed authorship to have fun in my world.  A natural consequence of your players having agency in your world is that they’ll indelibly leave their mark on it.  This might seem dangerous but let me tell you it actually made my job a lot easier.  Being diligent about listening to and observing my players during play sessions often led to ideas about where to take the story in ways that worked for both them and me.  The biggest example of this is the party’s main rival villain.  I’ll tell the full story in the comments if you want but the short of it is that this NPC was born out of the players mishearing a name, essentially inventing a new character with the misheard name, and expressing interest in interacting with _THAT_ character rather than the character I had written up for them to face.  Listening to them allowed me to craft a villain they’d find compelling and enjoy/hate interacting with simultaneously.  **The character my players “wrote” themselves ended up becoming the most important NPC they interacted with all campaign, with the best session in the whole campaign devoted to the party’s history and interactions with her -- and that character simply would not have existed if I had “overwritten” the players’ authorship over the world.**  

Now, as a caveat, I do want to say that I worked hard to let my players exhibit authorship in a way that didn’t overturn my own.  You could imagine that following up on too many disparate leads based on players’ expressed interests could easily cause the campaign to turn into the kind of “sandbox” we’d like to avoid, but it’s just something to keep in mind.  Your campaign fidelity is important too!
 
Solicit Feedback CONSTANTLY (Corollary: Your Players Don’t Know What They Want)
-------

As mentioned above, I found that always being observant and attentive to what my players did in sessions helped me craft the campaign to fit their needs.  Asking what they wanted outside of play also helped, and I would recommend anybody to do this frequently.  BUT I found that players did not always accurately articulate what they wanted from the campaign when asked directly.  They would use shorthand like “sandbox” to mean “meaningful choices” (as above), or describe a desire for “character development” when what they really wanted was an opportunity for their character’s mechanical skills to shine -– not quite the ""development"" I would have guessed.  I don’t blame them; almost by definition the players aren’t required to think about this kind of thing.  They’re there to roll some dice and solve some puzzles, and it’s been well documented elsewhere that “consumers” often have trouble articulating (even to themselves!) their desires and preferences.  

**It became really important for me to try to piece together, from players’ stated and enacted objectives for play, what their actual objectives really were.**  I think that developing this skill makes a DM not only much more flexible, but much wiser and much more likely to keep players around as, seemingly without the players needing to ask, the campaign tends to start meeting their needs more and more.
 
Off Days Are Normal.  You Won’t Please Everyone.  You Are Still Good At Your Job.  It’s A Hobby. Your Fun Is Important Too. Etc.
------
This seems like a really simple and smarmy “lesson” to end on, but I wanted to make sure I said it explicitly.  All of these “trite” DM “self-help” adages are nonetheless both extremely true and extremely effective.  Everyone feels like they aren’t skilled or experienced enough as a DM sometimes.  Everyone has that session where everything seems off and it looks like the players aren’t having fun.  These thoughts are normal and **I am telling you straight to your face that you can do this, and the more you practice your craft, the better you will be at it.**  Whether or not these thoughts ever go away is, in my experience, completely orthogonal to how well you actually perform as a DM.  I will tell you stories if you like about the times my players expressed dissatisfaction with things I had done as DM or I left a session just wanting to go bang my head against a wall, or the times I felt like I didn’t know how I’d finish the story in a way that made everyone happy.  I will tell you the story of how one of my players spent an hour of the final campaign session playing Terraria and it was somehow fine.  Just remember, the most important part of the game is showing up week after week, putting your best roll forward. **As a DM, you are the most important person at the table, full stop.  Your enjoyment, mental health, creative fulfillment, etc., all factor highly into how sustainable your campaign is.** So, make those things a priority and I promise the rest will improve.
 
There are a bunch of other lessons I learned as well along the way (“D&D isn’t a video game, so don’t fall into the trap of thinking you have to run it like one, even if your players act like it is,” “Don’t get personally attached to characters, either PCs or NPCs,” “Consistency is good not only for your rulings but your narrative power – don’t threaten to kill someone if you won’t kill them,” etc.) but these I think are the most important and the lessons that really took me from a very beginner, novice DM to someone who can literally say I finished a campaign that took players from level 1 to level 14.

-----------

I’m happy to hang out in the comments if anyone wants to chat about anything or hear stories, but mostly I just hope that, if you’re a new DM, you aren’t daunted by the scope of the hobby.  You already have the capacity to learn all the skills you need.  Practice, work hard, and keep your eye on the prize, and I’m confident you’ll be a great DM, and in time you’ll be able to look back on your own lessons learned from your own successfully-completed campaign.  Roll 20s!
",65,1527983387.0,8o1g0k,False,"So, I recently finished my first real, long-term D&D campaign.  It ran for five years and ~70 “episodes”) (with some hiatuses), both in-person and over Roll20, was entirely homebrew, took players from level 1 to level 14, and honestly is probably one of the bigger creative accomplishments of my life.  I’ve been reflecting on the experience of DMing a campaign like this and what I’ve learned from it, and wanted to share a few of the more important lessons that I’ll take into my next DMing gig.  Broadly, I found that the three big axes around which I could “optimize” the health of my game were: “player agency,” “campaign fidelity,” and “DM sanity.”  I didn’t explicitly call these categories out below for the most part, but this tri-axis system really came to inform a lot of what I did and how I learned from my experiences, so I thought I’d mention it.

For context, I basically started DMing in earnest at the start of the D&D Next Playtest (Summer 2012) and started this campaign in Summer 2013. So, still pretty green when I started, but hey, it worked out!  I know everyone hates those self-indulgent “LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY CAMPAIGN!!!” stories, so I’ve tried to keep examples from being overly frilly – of course, I’m happy to go into detail on any stories that would be helpful, but wanted to keep the lessons themselves as the focus, not my campaign.  I also don’t really like it when DMs present their own experiences as universally applicable and treat their advice as imperative, so I’ve tried hard to make it clear these lessons were meaningful to ME personally -- I hope they are also meaningful to you but I understand that everyone’s DM style and needs are different.  Anyway, without further ado, here they are:

----------

The single most important lesson I learned is to be flexible. One way to do that is to treat your story more like a TV show than a novel.
----------

I once heard the writers of a network TV show talk about how they went about planning and writing their story.  They started with the central premise and a strong idea of where they wanted to start and end.  They had a well-defined concept of the WHAT of their story (say, “The Story We Want To Tell”)  BUT, they also recognized that the WHAT (“The Story We Want To Tell”) wasn’t synonymous with the HOW (“The Way We Tell Our Story”)  They were ready to write characters out entirely, extend or compact seasons, divert storylines, and so on, because TV is episodic and subject to the whims of the network, audience, actors, etc.  Contrast that to novels, where the author literally has absolute control over both The Story They Want To Tell and The Way They Tell Their Story. Both of those conceptions work to perfectly craft exactly the right narrative, told in exactly the right way.  This great power helps the novelist make the story As Good As Possible, but it’s just not a power available to TV showmakers – or DMs writing their own campaign.
 
For my campaign, the premise was “what if the PCs lived in one of multiple parallel worlds created by the gods at different levels of ‘entropy’?” I built the whole story from that question.  I had a strong idea of how I’d start the story, how the PCs would discover the multiple worlds, and how the story would end.  BUT I didn’t know which of my players would stay or leave.  I didn’t know which NPCs would become important or not.  I didn’t know which hooks players would explore or ignore.  **Treating my story less like a novel and more like a TV show, with a strong idea of What Story I Wanted To Tell but flexibility in How I Told My Story, enabled the campaign to progress organically, meeting both my goals and the players’ needs throughout each arc, all the way to the end.** In fact, I literally broke my campaign into “seasons” and treated sessions as discrete “episodes” leading to “season finales,” etc.  It helped my organization and my mindset tremendously, provided natural break points and places for players to step away or join the campaign, and so on.  I really cannot recommend being flexible in this way enough.
 
Flexibility and Planning Are Two Sides of the Same Creative Coin
------

I’ve seen a lot of DMs online talk about the importance of developing “improv” as a skill.  Personally I suck pretty badly at improv.  And to be honest I don’t think Online DMs really understand what they are saying when they suggest this.  Usually it’s framed as “your games will go better if you’re good at improv and don’t force your session to rigidly conform to your plan!” But, strictly speaking, improv is the practiced performance skill of creating a compelling performance from unscripted/unplanned material, not simply the ability to successfully -- and _flexibly_ -- implement a plan in adverse conditions without clinging dogmatically to a crystallized set of rules.  Improv, defined as above, _can_ be a useful skill for DMs, but _by definition,_ it eschews planning in favor of adaptation, so the ability to implement long-term narrative structures such as foreshadowing is limited to the scope of the improv itself, since nothing outside of the improv’s unplanned material can be brought in. There’s nothing wrong with that! **But I think it’s entirely possible to be flexible and adapt, allowing your players to exhibit agency and be creative -- all while still planning and plotting to your heart’s content.**
 
For me, I found that my ability to contingency-plan and create organized story structures (within the framework described above) made it easier to be flexible in those moments when my players deviated from my “ideal” path.  It didn’t mean I had to abandon my plans or come up with content on the fly.  It just meant I had to use observation and analysis skills to read the situation and decide which set pieces to play or delay, when to pivot, etc. **I had enough contingency plans that instead of “improving,” I was able to be flexible by choosing from several options I had already thought about.**  This reduced my in-game stress considerably, because I honestly do suck at coming up with things on the fly most of the time.  And look, just to be clear, there will always be that one session where you didn’t have time to prep, or you weren’t able to predict your players’ latest weird obsession.  Improving a fun session or two when you need to is a good skill to have, if only so the fun doesn’t stop.  But what I’m saying is that I found smart, rigorous pre-planning a more “flexible” option than resigning myself to making things up as I went – and I don’t think it’s necessary to take that path if you don’t want to.
 

You Can Have It All: “Railroad vs. Sandbox” Is (Sometimes) a False Dichotomy.
-----

 I’m not here to start a big argument about “narrative” or “sandbox” games or whatever.  It’s my personal opinion that when most people talk about wanting their game to be a “sandbox,” what they really mean is that they want player choices to feel like they matter. 

 I think that (most!) D&D players don’t want to play Wizard Minecraft, walking through a world that does nothing until they interact with it and even then only reacting in kind.  I think most players _do_ want some (or even a lot of) narrative direction, some incentive to take actions, and some risks for their choices.  When people say they don’t want to get railroaded, what I think they mean is that they don’t want to feel like they’re NPCs in the DM’s little private novella. They want their choices to matter.  And I think that players (and some DMs) have picked up on this and operationalized the word “sandbox” to capture these feelings, even though IMO it’s a term not well designed for the usage.  And in the meantime, words like “linear,” “narrative-focused,” etc. have become dirty words.
 
**But I think you can have a well-designed, narratively-rich game that builds a linearly progressive story and delivers on things like foreshadowing and character development while still making your players’ choices have real consequences.**  A linear story doesn’t _require_ your players to feel railroaded. One thing that helped me was making sure that the players always knew that there was more going wrong in the world than they could fix with a single choice. This meant that _every_ big choice they made carried _some_ consequence, and gave them a sense of agency from square one.  I also learned that there were subtle ways to present players with multiple options such that one option was more appealing and players were more likely to pick it.  I also learned to use “magician’s choice” well, giving players more of the illusion of choice than an actual choice, which sounds like a cheat but, honestly, it got the job done for players experiencing a sense of agency, which is what they wanted.  **These tools allowed me to tell The Story I Wanted To Tell while still letting players have their agency in The Way The Story Was Told, keeping them from feeling railroaded and making it smoother for everyone.**
 

Your Players Are Authors Too.
--------

This flows pretty naturally from the immediately prior lesson I think a lot of DMs are scared to let their players have too much agency because they don't want their well-laid plans to go awry.  That's understandable, but I found that my players needed authorship to have fun in my world.  A natural consequence of your players having agency in your world is that they’ll indelibly leave their mark on it.  This might seem dangerous but let me tell you it actually made my job a lot easier.  Being diligent about listening to and observing my players during play sessions often led to ideas about where to take the story in ways that worked for both them and me.  The biggest example of this is the party’s main rival villain.  I’ll tell the full story in the comments if you want but the short of it is that this NPC was born out of the players mishearing a name, essentially inventing a new character with the misheard name, and expressing interest in interacting with _THAT_ character rather than the character I had written up for them to face.

There are a bunch of other lessons I learned as well along the way (“D&D isn’t a video game, so don’t fall into the trap of thinking you have to run it like one, even if your players act like it is,” “Don’t get personally attached to characters, either PCs or NPCs,” “Consistency is good not only for your rulings but your narrative power – don’t threaten to kill someone if you won’t kill them,” etc.) but these I think are the most important and the lessons that really took me from a very beginner, novice DM to someone who can literally say I finished a campaign that took players from level 1 to level 14.

-----------

I’m happy to hang out in the comments if anyone wants to chat about anything or hear stories, but mostly I just hope that, if you’re a new DM, you aren’t daunted by the scope of the hobby.  You already have the capacity to learn all the skills you need.  Practice, work hard, and keep your eye on the prize, and I’m confident you’ll be a great DM, and in time you’ll be able to look back on your own lessons learned from your own successfully-completed campaign.  Roll 20s!

Im 27F he's 31M. He lives with our mom - no rent, no bills, just sleeps and does drugs all day. He has an 8 year old daughter he's trying to get custody of. She was there along with my 5 year old daughter and saw the whole thing.

I was at my mom's yesterday. He came home in a bad mood from work and instantly said I had taken his spot on the couch. I laughed and told him how stupid that was he blew up. Instant rage. Calling me a bitch and telling me to go fuck myself, telling me to get the fuck out of ""his house"". We argued a bit but I started getting my daughter's things together to leave.  As I was walking through the hallway to get to the door, he walked past me and chest bumped me out of the way.

I fell on the ground screaming for him to stop but he just kept punching me. I stood up and he punched me again. My daughter and niece saw the whole thing. The fucking psycho called the cops like I was the one who was going to get in trouble. Like an idiot, I was still so in shock when the officers arrived and I told them I didn't want to press charges. I've never been in a situation like this so I had no clue what to do. 

After the adrenaline wore off I called the officer back and told them I wanted to press charges and am currently pursuing that. 

I went to the ER and they did a CT scan because of all the bruising on my face and head. Nothing is broken or damaged, I'm just bruised up and sore. I still can't close or open my mouth all the way. 

I'm really fucking angry. He's beat up my mom before as well as his ex-wife. I have a black eye, bruises all over my body and a fucked up jaw. I lost my brother over his stupid fucking rage.

"The way I understand it, is that we see only matter, and hardly any antimatter in the universe, and we don't understand where all the antimatter went that should have been created in the Big Bang as well, and this is called the Baryon asymmetry.

However, couldn't this just be a statistical fluke? If you generate matter and antimatter *approximately* 50/50, and then annihilate it pairwise, you're always going to get a small amount of either matter or antimatter left over. Maybe that small amount is what we see today?

As an example, let's say I have a fair coin, and do a million coin tosses. It's entirely plausible that I get eg. 500247 heads, and 499753 tails. When I strike out the heads against the tails, I have 494 heads, and no tails.

"In a two party, winner-takes-all system you can't vote for a third party you agree more with, because that is subtracting a vote from the major party that you agree with the most. And that's basically equivalent to voting for the party you agree the least with. So in essence: voting for the party you agree with the most is practically voting for the party you agree with the least. This is why it's a two party system. 

Now you have a country with two tribes that benefit from attacking anything the other tribe stands for. An us and them mentality on a more fundamental level then it has to be. You also artificially group stances of unrelated issues together, like social issues and economic issues,  and even issues inside of those. Why can I statistically predict your stance on universal health care if I know your stance on gun control? That doesn't make much sense. 

But the most crucial point is how the winner takes all system discourages cooperation on a fundamental level. Cooperation is is the most effective way to progress in politics, it's like rowing with the wind versus rowing against it. 

If we look at proportional representation systems, this cooperation is a must. Each party HAS to cooperate, negotiate and compromise with other parties if they even want to be in power at all. This is because multiple parties has to collaborate to form a government (equivalent of the white house) with a majority of votes between them. Since they are different parties in government, getting everyone on board every policy is not a given, so playing nice with the opposition is smart in case you need the extra votes in the legislature branch (house of representatives, senate). 

Since there is much less tribalism at play and voters are more likely to switch parties to something that suits them better if they are dissatisfied, the parties has to stay intellectually honest about the issues. The voters won't forgive corruption and lobbying the way they are likely to do in a two party system. 

I would argue that proportional representation is more democratic. This is because you can vote on a small party, say the environmental party for example, and the votes actually matter because the large parties would want to flirt with the small parties to get their representation in legislature and government. Giving the small party leverage to negotiate environmental policy with the large party.

The one argument I have heard in favor of the two party model is that it ensures competence in governing, because both parties would have had experience governing. But in practice, small parties will have proportionally small roles in a collaboration government as they grow, accumulating experience while bringing new ideas and approaches with them as they eventually reach a point where they have dangerous responsibility.

"I've been considering what novels really speak to me lately and think it would be fun to list the best ones in my mind and see what others say. Only rule is you are allowed just one book per series. 

My order is pretty definitively ranked in my mind, in descending order:

**Under Heaven**- Guy Gavriel Kay - A masterwork of re-imagined Chinese history with some fantastical elements.

**The Goblin Emperor** - Katherine Addision - Simply the most joyous main character I've had the pleasure to read with a simple yet touching story

**The Curse of Chalion** - Lois McMaster Bujold - The single greatest exploration of recovering from tragedy with one of the most empathetic and likable protagonists I've read.

**The Fifth Season** - N.K Jemisin - Utterly compelling and in terms of sheer literary craft it's a staggering achievement. The trilogy is complete (I'm not on the third book just yet) but this novel intrigued me from the moment I heard it's premise many years ago. 

**Deadhouse Gates** - Steven Erikson - What can I say about Malazan that hasn't already been said? In terms of the actual novels, it is the best of the bunch by a decent margin. I would also contend Midnight Tides or Reapers Gale to be as impactful. I will leave this list with the best quote of the book, and series.

"Lurking long enough, time to contribute!

I work for a large member-based travel agency as a Supervisor in the department taking calls for Rental Car reservations as well as Hotel reservations. We get people discounted rates for these companies but neither service is actually owned/operated by our company. I've been working in customer service for a year and *hot damn* I already resonate with so many stories from this sub.

Anyway...

I'll be Me and she'll be Completely Confused (CC). 

Me: You've reached bjlmag, a SUP in the Car department, can I have your name & member info please?

*Several minutes of blind ranting pass before she finally gives her information*

CC: I just picked up my car and it was terrible; they didn't even ask if my husband would drive!! I can't drive for 10 hours all by myself; he gonna drive whether they like it or not!

Me: I'm sorry to hear that, are you still close to the location? If you can go back, they can add him onto the contract. If he isn't added to the contract, though, he cannot drive the vehicle.

CC: He's not here!

Me: Was he with you when you arrived to pick up the car?

CC: NO

Me: Did you tell them that you wanted to add another driver?

CC: NO! They should know! You need to do it now;I won't go back there. They wasted my time and the manager is just a bitch!

*slams head into desk*

Me: Unfortunately maam I don't work for the rental company so I cannot make such changes on my end. Furthermore, he will need to be present to sign the contract and provide his driver's license, which can't be done on the phone. If you aren't close to where you rented the car I could try finding another nearby location for you? 

CC: NO, you're WRONG! They told me on the phone he don't need no driver's license!

Me: I'm sorry maam but that isn't correct, I apologize if you were misinformed but a driver's license is required to drive a rental car. 

CC: You're just no help! They told me he don't need no license! You just need his name and birthday, are you going to help me or not?

Me: I'm sorry maam, but he will need to provide a driver's license and sign a contract in order to drive the vehicle. 

CC: NO NO NO THEY SAID THAT! THEY SAID ON THE PHONE THEY JUST NEED HIS NAME AND BIRTHDAY!

Me: Maam, this is a matter of law. If somebody told you that a driver's license isn't required to drive a motor vehicle, they were not correct. I'd be happy to help you find a location where you can add your husband to your contract, but he will need to provide his driver's license before signing the contract. 

CC: Get me a supervisor NOW! 

Me: I am a supervisor, maam.

*CC mutters profanity and hangs up*

I wish I could say it's rare that people think they can drive rental cars without a license but we have to explain this pretty regularly. I've got plenty more outrageous stories; the travel  industry is rowdy.

Me: I'm sorry maam, but he will need to provide a driver's license and sign a contract in order to drive the vehicle. 

CC: NO NO NO THEY SAID THAT! THEY SAID ON THE PHONE THEY JUST NEED HIS NAME AND BIRTHDAY!

Me: Maam, this is a matter of law. If somebody told you that a driver's license isn't required to drive a motor vehicle, they were not correct. I'd be happy to help you find a location where you can add your husband to your contract, but he will need to provide his driver's license before signing the contract. 

CC: Get me a supervisor NOW! 

Me: I am a supervisor, maam.

*CC mutters profanity and hangs up*

I wish I could say it's rare that people think they can drive rental cars without a license but we have to explain this pretty regularly. I've got plenty more outrageous stories; the travel  industry is rowdy.

"On May 25 Karl Szwet, a resident of Northwest Indiana and active member of the Chicago bike scene, was on a ride with a friend known only as “BILL”.  On the ride Karl reportedly fell off his bike after suffering a heart attack AND an aneurism.  Karl was taken to the hospital thanks to “Bill.” It took the hospital around 4 days to find a family member to contact. Karl is still in the hospital and things are looking very grim. He has been unconscious since the accident and doctors are not confident he will make a recovery.


Karl’s family is trying to find “Bill” or anyone who may have been close with Karl. Bill’s first name was all the hospital could provide. Karl was in contact with his family but not enough to be sharing his daily activities or things like that. The family also doesn’t believe he was active on social media at all. 

We do know that Karl was a long time participant of the Chicago Critical Mass, and he worked on repairing bikes for kids. He was also active in a variety of other bike activities in the region.

The family is just wanting to ask some questions and help make sure all of Karl’s things are taken care of. They don’t even know where his truck or his wallet is. If you know Karl and can help provide ANY information at all that may be useful to the family PLEASE DM me.

If you don’t know anything to help PLEASE at least give this an Upvote to help with visibility.

TL;DR - Looking for anyone who was a friend to Chicago area cyclist Karl Szwet to talk with his family. Just read the post, it’s important enough for your time. Please and thank you so much.

Edit*- To be 100% clear, I did not know Karl. Nor am I looking to talk to anyone who new him myself other than to confirm the connection. I’m heavily involved in the bike community in Indiana. Karl’s niece is a friend of mine and asked if I could help them get the word out to see if we could get them anyone to talk to to answer some pretty basic questions that no one seems to know answers to. I have some personal information about Karl that his family has given me to ask anyone who knew him about. If they know the information the family wants me to give the person who knew him (hopefully Bill) their phone number.

**Summary**

  William Leslie Arnold was a teenager when he shot his parents. It started as an argument about taking the family car on a date to the drive in and escalated to murder. He had a rough relationship with his mom, who possibly had her own mental issues, and seems to have only killed his dad because he walked in shortly after he shot her 6 times. He shot his dad another 6 times. He fabricated an elaborate story that would explain his parent's sudden absence and sent his brother to the neighbor's house while he disposed of the evidence. He then carried on as usual by going on the date with his girlfriend in the family car. He went on to live a pretty normal life for about 2 weeks, attending church and school and more dates, not giving any indication that he had killed his parents.

  I won't spoil it all, but he was caught and sent to prison when his story fell apart. Nine years later he escapes prison and disappears. Read all about it below in these lengthy and detailed articles. It truly seems straight out of a movie. The guy was clearly smart.

**Possible Outcomes**

  Before the first post was removed, u/pofish mentioned [Joseph Newton Chandler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Newton_Chandler_III) was the first person that came to mind that fit the description of a fugitive like Arnold. There are several physical characteristics that seem to kind of line up.

 * Arnold's booking photo on June 9, 1959 into Nebraska penitentiary in Lincoln has him listed at 5'7"", 121lbs at age 16. His initial booking photo has him listed at 5'8"" on October 11, 1958. It says in the article above that he bulked up to 160lbs. Chandler is listed at 5'7"", 160lbs. Unfortunately the last known photo of Arnold was taken on booking and looked nothing like the escapee, prompting updated photos for all inmates after that.

 * ~~They both are listed as having gray eyes.~~  Eye color for Arnold is listed as brown, Chandler's as gray

 * They are both *roughly* the same age, Chandler assuming the identity of someone born in 1937, Arnold was born in 1942. 


Another possibility is that Arnold moved to Brazil or Argentina. The investigator that had kept track of the case many years later learned that he had been searched for by name from an ISP in South America. Another suspicious search from South America was conducted for his inmate number, 20841, rather than by name. 

Update: In 1968 a Brazilian immigration document with William Leslie Arnold's name seems to show that he did indeed make it to Brazil at some point, but whether he remained there is unclear.

**Discussion**

  So what do you think happened to William Leslie Arnold? Is it possible that he assumed another identity like Joseph Newton Chandler and is living among us somewhere, drawing little attention to himself? Is he Chandler? Any suggestions for further research would be great. The family of Arnold (the brother he left orphaned) would rather not know what happened. I kind of don't blame him.

",0,"  Had to repost because I failed to check the sidebar before posting and left out a summary and more links. I found this article and thought I’d share. I had never heard of this particular case and it's fascinating. 


**Summary**

  William Leslie Arnold was a teenager when he shot his parents. It started as an argument about taking the family car on a date to the drive in and escalated to murder. He had a rough relationship with his mom, who possibly had her own mental issues, and seems to have only killed his dad because he walked in shortly after he shot her 6 times. He shot his dad another 6 times. He fabricated an elaborate story that would explain his parent's sudden absence and sent his brother to the neighbor's house while he disposed of the evidence. He then carried on as usual by going on the date with his girlfriend in the family car. He went on to live a pretty normal life for about 2 weeks, attending church and school and more dates, not giving any indication that he had killed his parents.

  I won't spoil it all, but he was caught and sent to prison when his story fell apart. Nine years later he escapes prison and disappears. Read all about it below in these lengthy and detailed articles. It truly seems straight out of a movie. The guy was clearly smart.

**Possible Outcomes**

  Before the first post was removed, u/pofish mentioned [Joseph Newton Chandler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Newton_Chandler_III) was the first person that came to mind that fit the description of a fugitive like Arnold. There are several physical characteristics that seem to kind of line up.

 * Arnold's booking photo on June 9, 1959 into Nebraska penitentiary in Lincoln has him listed at 5'7"", 121lbs at age 16. His initial booking photo has him listed at 5'8"" on October 11, 1958. It says in the article above that he bulked up to 160lbs. Chandler is listed at 5'7"", 160lbs. Unfortunately the last known photo of Arnold was taken on booking and looked nothing like the escapee, prompting updated photos for all inmates after that.

 * ~~They both are listed as having gray eyes.~~  Eye color for Arnold is listed as brown, Chandler's as gray

 * They are both *roughly* the same age, Chandler assuming the identity of someone born in 1937, Arnold was born in 1942. 


Another possibility is that Arnold moved to Brazil or Argentina. The investigator that had kept track of the case many years later learned that he had been searched for by name from an ISP in South America. Another suspicious search from South America was conducted for his inmate number, 20841, rather than by name. 

Update: In 1968 a Brazilian immigration document with William Leslie Arnold's name seems to show that he did indeed make it to Brazil at some point, but whether he remained there is unclear.

**Discussion**

  So what do you think happened to William Leslie Arnold? Is it possible that he assumed another identity like Joseph Newton Chandler and is living among us somewhere, drawing little attention to himself? Is he Chandler? Any suggestions for further research would be great. The family of Arnold (the brother he left orphaned) would rather not know what happened. I kind of don't blame him. 


Edited to add more info that I had not previously seen. There are lots of pieces to this case.

Another edit: Wayback Machine links (hopefully these work for those of you in the EU). I couldn't get an alternative link to Part two, sorry about that. If anyone can help find one that would be awesome.

"Reposting this because the mods removed it for violating the 24 hour rule, so if you saw it yesterday, that’s why you’re seeing it again. 

I think Oda dropped a huge hint regarding the Void Century in this latest chapter, and no, it has nothing to do with a Straw Hat. Instead it’s a detail I feel has been glossed over, mainly due to the ending of the chapter (Oda knows what he’s doing.)

It’s the name of the castle: Pangaea. 

For those unaware, all the continents on Earth used to be one, before tectonic shifts pulled them away, and that super-continent is called Pangaea. 

This is an old theory that has never had the popularity some others have, and I don’t know where it started, but I do know it’s most vocal champion in the community has been Ed from the One Piece Podcast, so credit to him for most of the ideas that are soon to be presented. 

Back before the Void Century, the islands of the One Piece world, at least those on the grand line, used to be one: The Ancient Kingdom. At the end of the Void Century, the world was remade by the new World Government. 

There are some key pieces of evidence, and I’ll go over them in the order they were introduced to the series:

1) The weather of the Grand Line. It’s odd that the rest of the world has normal weather, and all the islands have their own magnetic pull. The idea is that they all came from one island originally. (Aside: Even if this is true, I don’t think that explains the eccentricities of the Grand Line. I think that will have something to do with Uranus.)

2) Pluton: a battleship that was capable of destroying entire islands. Likely what would have fractured the Ancient Kingdom. 

3) Oars. Oh, wait, that’s not his full name is it? That would be Oars “The Continent Puller.” Now, that’s a bit of an odd nickname, unless, of course, it’s literal. 

So the idea at this point is that the Ancient Kingdom was shattered by Pluton, then Oars, likely made to do so as a slave and perhaps with others of his kind, pulled the pieces of the Ancient Kingdom apart, giving shape to the grand line. 

There was one other piece of evidence introduced before this latest one...

4) The Celestial Dragons, who, as this chapter reiterates, are “Descendant’s of this World’s Creators.” Yet another literal title, if their ancestors are the ones who reshaped the world of One Piece during the Void Century. 

And that of course brings us to Chapter 906 and...

5) Pangaea: the name of the world when it was whole, and the name of the castle at the center of the Holy Land. Oda clearly picked this name for a reason, and it is not one that can be confused for something else. Located in the center of the seas, and once the center of the world, the founders of Mariejoa, who reshaped the world, reside at Pangaea. 

So that’s the old theory, and I think over time it has only gotten stronger and stronger. And this latest update just solidified the claim even more. 

Whatever happened during the Void Century, I am confident that it involved the reshaping of the planet and the creation of the One Piece world as we know it.

"*https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8eeymh/i18m_have_a_secret_girlfriend18f_and_i_just_found/?utm_source=reddit-android* **Original post**

Since the last post quite a bit happened. I guess I should start from where things left off.

We didn't know what to do, whether we would have an abortion, or keep the baby. After a more days of discussing it, we decided that abortion was best for everyone. I didn't exactly have the money to give her for an abortion, so I called and asked my older brother to borrow the money, and i guess he let my mom know what we had decided because she called, wanting to speak to my girlfriend.

I let the two of them talk. They were on the phone talking for over an hour, and when they were done, my girlfriend told me that she wanted to keep the baby. It was her body, and her mind was made up, and if i loved her like i said i did i would respect it. I dont know what my mom said to change her mind, but whatever she said worked, and my girlfriend wouldn't even discuss abortion again after that.

We started to plan what to do next. We would go to South Carolina, and be together, we knew that it would be hard, but we were kind of excited.

I didn't speak to my girlfriend for 4 days after that. She wouldn't return my calls or answer my texts. I didn't know what to do, I called my mom and told her that I was worried and what was going on. The next morning, my brother and my and my mom were at my school, in a really nice coincidence,  my girlfriend sent me a text from her sisters phone.

Her family found out. The one friend that she thought she could trust told her family everything once she had decided she would keep the baby. They took away her car, and her phone. Her older brother even beat her. She told me that they were sending her back, and she was so scared.

That morning, my family and I went to her house. My mom was fearless, she pushed right past my girlfriends parents as they opened the door. My mom had her down the stairs before as anyone could put up any real resistance.  

But that is when all hell broke loose. Her older brother grabbed at my mom, and my brother hit him. He didn't go down, and a few seconds later they were both rolling around the lawn.

My girlfriend  was crying and saying how sorry she was, as she hid her face in my mom's chest, my mom was walking her to the rental. Her mom was crying, her dad was yelling. It wasnt in English so I dont know what was said. The fight ended, both were bleeding, but I think my brother won.

We went right to the airport.  Getting a flight was much quicker than I thought. My girlfriend cried for most of the flight. And for days after we got to SC. I didn't know how I could make things okay after what she went through. A week after coming home,  I promised her that I would take care of her and our child, and I would love them both for the rest of my life. I proposed with my grandmother's ring. She said yes. 

As for the baby, and school. My mom proposed a deal, she said that she would take care of all of the day to day stuff for the baby, and also the expenses as long as we both are full time students. And after we finish school, living a good life is all the repayment that she needs.

I think she is also lowkey trying to convert my girlfriend to christianity.  She has gotten her to come to church with us for the last couple of sundays.

**TL:DR We decided to abort. Then she changed her mind. Her parents found out and we had to run. Now we are in SC, and I proposed.**

P.S. I am sorry that I didn't end up following the great advice that I received from the good people here at /r/relationship_advice. In the end we just played it by ear and followed our hearts and our faith. Thank you all for showing such kindness in my last post.

Since the last post quite a bit happened. I guess I should start from where things left off.

We didn't know what to do, whether we would have an abortion, or keep the baby. After a more days of discussing it, we decided that abortion was best for everyone. I didn't exactly have the money to give her for an abortion, so I called and asked my older brother to borrow the money, and i guess he let my mom know what we had decided because she called, wanting to speak to my girlfriend.

I let the two of them talk. They were on the phone talking for over an hour, and when they were done, my girlfriend told me that she wanted to keep the baby. It was her body, and her mind was made up, and if i loved her like i said i did i would respect it. I dont know what my mom said to change her mind, but whatever she said worked, and my girlfriend wouldn't even discuss abortion again after that.

We started to plan what to do next. We would go to South Carolina, and be together, we knew that it would be hard, but we were kind of excited.

I didn't speak to my girlfriend for 4 days after that. She wouldn't return my calls or answer my texts.

Loki says this line, creates a weapon, and then attempts to kill Thanos. There has been much speculation about why Loki would do something that would so obviously result in his death, and I think I have the answer: I think Loki was giving Thor the idea of forging a new weapon to defeat Thanos.

The 'sun' he was referring to represents Nidavellir.

When Thor wakes up on the Guardians' ship, the only thing on his mind is going to Nidavellir and forging Stormbreaker. I don't think he came up with this idea on his own.

There's even a line in *Infinity War* where he refers to Stormbreaker as ""the god-killing kind"" of weapon. Seems like the kind of thing that would come in handy when going up against a goddess.

I received a call of a man walking in the middle of the street. It was dark out, he appeared to be intoxicated, and he was yelling at some nearby turkeys (thank you for the detailed call, whoever called this in). He didn't have a flashlight, there were few to no street lights, he was wearing dark clothing, so he was a danger to himself or anyone who may swerve to avoid him.

I found him exactly as described, in the middle of the street. He stopped in the lane to face me as I contacted him. He was swaying from side to side as he stood still, and from his breath, speech, and eyes I could tell he was drunk.

He replied, ""I'm fine.""

""What's going on tonight?""

He paused for about five seconds before replying, ""I'm training for a marathon."" I hate drunks, especially sarcastic ones.

"This woman made my life a living hell in high school. She was my dad’s girlfriend. She treated me like shit. I had to sleep in the basement(not a nice basement: very dingy, unheated, and unfinished). The only bed available to me was a water bed with no heater. When I started freezing in the winter on unheated water in an unheated basement, my dad had to sneak me a water bed heater. All of my childhood and family possessions went into the basement when we moved in and when my dad moved us out he left it all. Photos, baby clothes, mementos from our lives, everything gone. We had to move out in a matter of minutes because she flipped out and took a knife to every piece of brand new furniture my dad had bought her a few months before. When she got evicted a few years later she didn’t call us or anything and let all the stuff go to the dump. On top of that, while I was living there, she stole and pawned my mother’s diamond engagement and wedding rings which my mother had given to me after the divorce. She also stole and pawned my trumpet. She is the first person I ever hated and when I just now found out she had died I danced around the living room screaming “Yesssss, she’s dead!” I fucking hate that woman. May she rot in hell.

"A little context. Last fall, I went and saw The Beatles: Love, the show in Las Vegas. I really enjoyed the Beatles songs that the show is set to. I hadnt heard many Beatles songs previously, other than the ones that are everywhere, Come Together, Hey Jude, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, etc. So, I decided to listen to all the albums, in order, with some time in between, like a month, to let the most recent album sink in. And give me the chance to listen to it again a couple more times before the next one. And i like the feeling of anticipation for the next album. Instantly, once I listened to Please Please Me, I was hooked. After I listened to Rubber Soul last month, I really got the sense of why the Beatles are so popular, so famous, and their legacy is so great. The album was incredible.

But, Revolver has taken it to another level. What an incredible album. So many great songs. Once Eleanor Rigby came on, and I heard ""All the lonely people, where do they all come from?"" I about had to pull the truck over. I was just entranced by the song. I love it. Then Im Only Sleeping, my second favorite on the album. Great song and really has the first true psychedelic sound in a Beatles song to it, in my opinion. And its just great song, after great song from there. Finally, Tomorrow Never Knows is something else. I didnt know what the hell I was listening to. Imagine what it sounded like in 1966. Must have really blew some heads off.

"I’ve tried posting this three times already, hopefully fourth time’s the charm.

Having these albums mentioned in the recent thread about the best FFA inspiration albums kicked me back into gear for finishing Makoto’s album.

Despite her colors being pink and green as a Scout, Makoto wears a heck of a lot of orange, yellow, and lime green. She tends to err on the side of being simple with her accessories and loves classic shoes like loafers.

On the personal side, I always identified with Makoto because she was the tallest at 5’6” (lol), and I am a 5’8” Asian American chick with broad shoulders and a medium to large build, who grew up in a very Asian neighborhood. I always felt large and unfeminine compared to my cute, petite peers. Also living in Japan for 2 years didn’t help this, as they don’t carry my shoe size, and I once had a smaller 7th grade student who turned around and got startled at the sight of me and literally fell over onto his desk with a, “wow.”

I really appreciate how Makoto was never drawn to hunch over to meet her friend’s height (that I know of, anyway), and in conjunction with her tomboyish karate-loving demeanor, also wanted to get married and open a bakery.

"The thirty-eighth edition of Survivor is currently filming in Fiji and Inside Survivor has learned from a number of sources that the title and theme of the season will be Island of Extinction.

What does that mean? Why does it sound like the title of a future Jurassic Park movie? Are we going to see a literal Dodo on Survivor? All valid questions. Let me try and explain the best I can.

After each Tribal Council, the eliminated castaway will have a choice to leave the game or go to the Island of Extinction where they will have no shelter, limited food supplies and nothing but time on their hands as they await a chance to potentially get back in the game. They can choose to quit at any time. Basically Redemption Island but without the weekly duels.

Earlier this week Inside Survivor announced four returning castaways would be competing on season 38 and one can’t help but think this twist is a way to prolong their screen-time should they be voted out. It could also act as an incentive for the newbies not to eliminate the veterans, knowing that there is a chance they could come back.

Island of Extinction sounds like an updated version of the original Ghost Island concept which was one of the ideas on the table for season 30 back in 2014. Inside Survivor posted about the old Ghost Island concept last year after a source shared with us a pitch document detailing the theme. In the pitch, Ghost Island is described as a location where eliminated players live together with “a shelter and only meager supplies” while waiting for an opportunity to return at a later point in the season.

The pitch went on to say that those remaining on the island would compete in an endurance challenge both at the merge and on Day 37, where the winner would be reintroduced to the game. It also said that the focus would be on “an entirely new kind of survival – of the mental kind” and that the lack of alliances would create “a new kind of politicking” where people would “try and figure out how to get others to quit” to increase their chances.

It’s unconfirmed as of this moment whether or not Island of Extinction will run exactly like the original Ghost Island concept, but based on the earlier description, it sounds remarkably similar. But would it be enjoyable to watch people trying to make each other quit? It feels like that could turn nasty and uncomfortable very quickly. On the other end of the spectrum, the eliminated players could choose to look at their stay on the Island of Extinction as a free vacation, which could make for incredibly dull television.

An example would be Elkie’s [kiss](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8O6IknNLo) and Yeeun’s [neodo nal wonhajanha](https://youtu.be/u9OxRFab6o4) in Hobgoblin. 

A more popular example would be Sana’s [shy shy shy](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nQb2hJGsdZc) and Momo’s [joreujima eolma gaji ana bureuge haejulkke Baby](https://youtu.be/jNxDpC5t938). These were not the original killing parts, just ones that were loved by the public.

"Przejechałem się dziś 50 km na rowerku, trasą przez las i wracałem do Białegostoku pod górkę taką.

Patrzę że budują za pieniądze niemieckiego podatnika nową ścieżkę rowerową, także warto się przejechać jak za swoje. Jadę, jadę i kombinuję że chujowe te niemieckie dotacje bo ten polbruk jest w chuj nierówny.

Prawdziwą przyczynę nierówności odkryłem dość szybko.

Otóż ścieżka rowerowa była do tego stopnia nowa że musiano ją wyrównać specjalnym urządzeniem znanym jako walec drogowy.

Ten walec był dość mały więc go odkryłem kiedy on zjeżdżał ze wzniesienia na które ja właśnie wjeżdżałem.

Ciekawa informacja na temat walców drogowych: ta część walcująca nie ma hamulców.

Takiego zwrotu jaki ja wykonałem zawodowi kolarze by się nie powstydzili.

Normalnie czułem się jak Indiana Jones w odzieży termoaktywnej.

Innym w takich sytuacjach staje całe życie przed oczami, drugim  przypominają się nakazy religijne.

Mi przed oczami stanęła strona 148 Fizyki dla klas 8. prof. Maksymiliana Piłata, rozdział Bezwładność i przyspieszenie kątowe.

Stało tam że skoro obiekt A ważący szacunkowo półtora tony porusza się przed obiektem B ważącym sto kilo plus rower plus pizza... to obiekt B musi naprawdę szybko spierdalać.

Co też uczyniłem, zjeżdżając w epickim tempie na samym dole do rowu.

Operator walca objebał mnie za wejście na teren budowy pomimo, że żadnej tabliczki nigdzie nie było.

Postanowiłem kontynuować podróż nowo wyrównaną ścieżką, wychodząc z założenia, że teraz walec będę miał za sobą i mnie nie dogoni.

Nie przewidziałem tylko jednego

Że kierownik budowy zechce wypróbować równość ścieżki zjeżdżając po niej swoim Mercedesem.  Wiem że to Mercedes bo ten celownik pojawia się do tej pory jak zamknę oczy.

"This happened about 10yrs ago in my Army days during a deployment. I was in a scout platoon (19D) and we had been tasked to set up a screen line on a long empty stretch of road on the outskirts of a town where a task force operation was going on. Essentially we were sitting in place intercepting anyone fleeing from the town for an operation lasting days, so it got incredibly boring, incredibly fast. We did what we could to keep ourselves entertained, while still trying to stay vigilant and not get complacent. Pretty delicate balancing act.

Now our platoon sergeant (SFC) had a tendency to be bipolar, switching back and forth from unyielding hard-ass dickbag, to happy, friendly, and just goofy AF. This made him generally unpleasant to deal with at any given point in time, as both extremes of his personality were very annoying. So to set the scene, we have been sitting in our humvees in one spot stretched along the road, waiting and watching diligently for 3 days.

I was the Lieutenant's (LT) gunner, and we were passing time as best we could, talking, eating, listening to music on tiny speakers, etc, when the platoon sergeant got bored and started playing on the radio(on our platoon freq, which is only monitored by us). Over the course of hours, he would radio our truck to talk to the LT, just to be silly and pass the time. (apparently his truck had got tired of talking to him, and he was bored) So for hours we hear shit like,  

SFC - ""Hey Red 1(LT's callsign), this is Red 4, over (SFC's callsign)""  

LT - ""4 this is 1, what's up, over""  

SFC - ""Whatcha thinkin bout?""  


After a few hours of this type of nonsense, my LT is annoyed beyond measure, and stops answering the radio for him. This only encourages the SFC to spam platoon freq even more. Finally the LT looks at me and says 'you answer that shit, I'm sick of dealing with his bullshit.' Haha, NO PROBLEM SIR.

If you've been deployed, you know that bootleg music and movies are the main way you stay entertained, and I probably had close to every song known to man downloaded on my Ipod at that point, including random things like slow jazz, classical, and other assorted elevator type music. So I grab the radio, and in my best automated voice impression I say ""Hello, you've reached the 1 truck. All of our associates are currently busy at the moment, so please stay on the line and a representative will be with you shortly.""

Now that in and of itself could easily have earned me an ass-chewing, but I felt compelled to go the extra mile and held the mic up to my Ipod speakers playing a very mellow sax arrangement of the Girl from Ipanema. On a military radio, if someone is speaking on that frequency, you can't key over them until they stop broadcasting. So my LT is looking at me kinda stunned (so are the other gunners I can see in their humvees) as I play that music for a good 60 seconds or so, tying up our platoon freq and forcing SFC to listen to this.

I pull the mic away from the speakers and LT looks relieved, thinking the joke is over, but at this point I say, ""Your call is very important to us. Please stay on the line and our next available representative will be with you shortly."" Then he gets another 60 seconds or so of Girl from Ipanema. When I finally release the mic, and the platoon net is clear, my LT, our dismounts, and every other gunner is dying laughing, but SFC doesn't respond, and even the LT is afraid to call back there, as SFC has a history of doing 180s on his bipolar switch at the slightest provocation.

So after a good 5 min or so, we finally hear the mic beep as SFC gets on to answer me, ""Red 1g (my callsign), if that wasn't the funniest shit I've ever heard, you'd be in serious shit right now. Put Red1 back on the mic and stay off the fucking radio.""

TL;DR - Platoon Sgt is being annoying on the radio, LT gets tired of it, tells me to deal with it. Which I do, by putting him on hold, complete with elevator waiting music.

"so i came out to my brother today, he's the first to know. 

we were on our way to the movies, and stopped to get food. sitting in the car eating chipotle and he started asking me if I was seeing any of the girls in my year, a frequent question from him lol. when i said no then he started asking me if i have a type, blonde or brunette or redhead; did I like one more than the other. I wasn't planning on coming out today, was going to do in later in the summer, but I was just turned him and said 'guys, my type is guys'. 

He asked if I was joking, I said I wasn't. He told me to be serious, was I playing around, again I told him I wasn't. And then he was like interesting, I had no idea...

Then he told me guys wasn't a specific enough category, and asked blonde boys, brown hair, gingers so i told him I don't really care about hair color. then he asked about height, my height, shorter or taller. I told him I haven't really thought about and he was like 'so you're keeping your options open, smart guy'.  Took him 30seconds to move from his annoying questions about girls to his annoying questions about guys lol. 

He drove us to the movies, and when we got there he asked me how i was feeling because i was pretty quiet. I don't really know how I felt actually, this huge thing had happened and I wasn't really sure how to take it in. He offered to take us somewhere where we could talk, but I told him maybe after the movie. We got out the car he hugged me and told me in honour of my 'big day' he'd even get me a large popcorn lol, but then he got serious for a moment and was like ""i love you, and don't ever forget that, ok"". 

after the movie he elbowed me and goes ""so, you still gay?"", which actually made me laugh. so he's still the same him, which means a lot. he asked more serious questions on the way home, how long have you know/ who knows/how did i feel now/if there was anyway he could be more supportive...and then ended by asking which Avenger was my favourite, I said spiderman and he laughed and said so you do have a type. 


i don't know why im posting this here, probably because i don't really have anyone else to tell. i know i've only told one person, but it still feels like this huge weight off of me. knowing that my brother has my back, feels like no matter how anyone else takes it I'm gonna be alright because I he'll be there.",21,1528021465.0,8o5jp0,False,"so i came out to my brother today, he's the first to know.

"So I was using the legacy twitch dashboard up until maybe a week ago. There was a url that would force the old one. Not only did I find it aesthetically more pleasing, but I was able to zoom in a couple of times on my browser and the chat was the perfect size for me to clearly read it on my second monitor without assistance.

With the new dashboard forced the chat takes up maybe half, if that, the size it used to. Unless there's some way to stretch the chat across two tiles, which would be nice. But I'm a tad less responsive to my chat, which kinda sucks since I was hyped for the reduced stream delay making interacting so seamless.

I have keratoconus, which is a degradation of the shape of the cornea. My case is fairly mild, so I don't wear hard contacts for it which you normally would. But I also don't wear glasses at my PC because I originally only wore them for long distance vision and my glasses are mainly still geared towards that. But I have problems with contrast vision, things are little less clear (Especially since my 2nd monitor is on the side of the eye that has the condition presenting far more), and I can get ghost images underneath stuff. So having a wider chat that takes up more real estate on the screen is a lot easier on me.

I'm kind of hoping that someone at twitch with their ear to the ground can maybe just let me use the old tech again, or maybe even take my idea to stretch the chat across another tile. But that's probably a long shot at this point, and I'd be glad to hear any potential solutions that keep the ease and convenience of the dashboard format intact while providing better visual clarity for myself.",8,1528024488.0,8o5twh,False,"So I was using the legacy twitch dashboard up until maybe a week ago.

"I have finally reached a breaking point and have decided to leave my husband. The decision itself feels good and I know it's the right one, but I'm overwhelmed with the logistics of how it will happen. 
I am 25, and we have been together since we were 17. I worked to put him through college, with the promise that when he got a good job in his field I could go to college and start my career. That didn't happen- he performed poorly in school because his fraternity was more important than his school work, and so he's been unable to find a position in his somewhat competitive field. He works, but roughly 45% of his income goes to his student loans. I stay home and take care of our 21 month old daughter, because since I have no degree, any money I could bring in would go to childcare. 
So I'm put in this really awful position. In all honesty, I've only stayed this long because I felt like I had no other choice, but recent events have pushed me over the edge. 

My short term plan is to stay with my mother. I'm not crazy about this, because she's emotionally abusive and controlling, but she's the only family/support system I have, as my husband has driven away any and all friends I've ever had. She is a teacher so will be home this summer and can watch my daughter. Hopefully I can quickly find some work (waiting tables, maybe?) to save up as much money as I can before she goes back to work in September, but after that I'm not sure what I can/should do. 
I would very much like to go back to school, but I don't see how that's feasible, as I'll need a job to pay for childcare while I take classes and there's only so many hours in the day. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any advice? I am in way over my head. ",16,1528008329.0,8o48gq,False,"I have finally reached a breaking point and have decided to leave my husband.

Tim has now been in two Marvel films. (F**ANT-MAN**tastic Four) Gregg has only been in **ONE**. This will only further strain their relationship. I suspect Gregg will feel a Biblical level of betrayal. Let us pray that it doesn't end violently.


To be meta for a moment: I was always praying that this would happen from the moment it was revealed Gregg was in the first film. I know the Marvel guys are fans of On Cinema, so I had a suspicion Tim would turn up in some way. I'm so happy we get to experience the drama surrounding this now. What a time to be alive for an On Cinema fan.

Over the last few decades, there has been an incredible change in society. Thanks to the hard work of countless activists, campaigners and pressure groups, homosexuality has gone from being illegal to being accepted and legally recognised in the Western World within a single generation. LGBTQ+ people have good reason to celebrate. 

Having said all that, there is still a lot of hard work ahead of us. In much of Asia and Africa, LGBTQ+ people are still marginalised and even subject to the death penalty in Afghanistan, Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and some parts of Nigeria and Somalia.

We should also recognise that  recent progress hasn't been distributed evenly: [50% of Gay African American Men are HIV Positive](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/01/silent-epidemic-black-gay-men-in-us-face-50-50-risk-of-hiv) and suicide rates amongst young LGBTQ+ people remain [1.5 to 3 times higher](http://www.sprc.org/sites/default/files/migrate/library/SPRC_LGBT_Youth.pdf) than for young cishet people. 

Here at /r/MensLib, we'd like to come together to discuss issues affecting LGBTQ+ men and trans people of all gender identities. During the month of June, posts about LGBTQ+ issues will get a snazzy rainbow flair, courtesy of /u/Raiskream. We'd also like to take this opportunity to promote a few charities championing the cause of LGBTQ+ people around the world. If it's within your means, then we'd love it if you could spare some cash for:

* [The Rainbow Railroad](https://www.rainbowrailroad.ca/) and the [Iranian Railroad](http://irqr.ca/2016/) helping LGBTQ+ people escape persecution in Chechnya and Iran
* [Lambda Legal](https://www.lambdalegal.org) fighting for legal equality for LGBTQ+ people in the USA

* [Stonewall](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/) campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights in the United Kingdom
* [OutRight Action International](https://www.outrightinternational.org/) fighting for LGBTQ+ Human Rights all over the world

"For those not in the know, AlternateHistoryHub is a Youtube channel that posts videos about, well, alternate histories. The videos are, for the most, well-researched enough for a short Youtube-friendly overview of a specific historical moment and the ramifications of it. You'll get a few errors here and there, and glossing over some nuances, but nothing really too bad.

At least, that describes the most recent videos. I stumbled upon [What if Communism was never invented?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP2k2rEMsRI) recently. It's from 2015, and definitely represents a portrait of the Alternate Historian as a young man.

There's quite a bit wrong with the video, including its analysis of Communism as an ideology in and of itself, but this is badhistory, not badpolitics, so I'll be sticking to criticizing the historical errors present.

The first slip occurs around 0:18, when the narrator says ""What if Communism was never invented? What if Karl Marx's ideas were simply never spread?"" The problem with this is that the ideology of Communism predates Karl Marx - or at least the label does. You don't have to look much further than the first line of the *Communist Manifesto* to figure that out: ""A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre is Communism"". That line wouldn't really make much sense if Marx himself invented Communism.

The next minute is just a brief rundown of Communism as an ideology and the history of it as a political system. At 1:16, however, the narrator states that ""Before the [Soviet Union], Marxists and Socialists had the same ideas."" Ummm... no.
Considering Marx devoted around a quarter of the *Communist Manifesto* to talking shit about other socialists and why their ideas are trash (specifically Section III ""Socialist and Communist Literature""), saying of 'Petty-Bourgeois Socialism': 

> ""Ultimately, when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all intoxicating effects of self-deception, this form of Socialism ended in a miserable fit of the blues.""

... it would be pretty inaccurate to state that 'Marxists and Socialist had the same ideas.' Hell, that's not even getting into the squabbles that were had in later decades (which I admittedly don't know enough to comment on).

At 1:53 though, is where things really kick into gear:

> ""At the end of World War I, socialists fell into two main camps with the start of the Russian Revolution: The Bolsheviks, later called Communists, were those who believed in a violent revolution to bring about Communist paradise, and the Anti-Bolsheviks; those who believed Socialism could evolve naturally into European political systems through democracy. After World War I, the Bolsheviks distanced themselves from the Communists gained influence, all through elections and not revolution.

Honestly I'm not even sure how to respond to this. While there was a notable split post-Russian Revolution - or rather, post Russian Civil War - about how Communists should react to the Bolsheviks taking power (with Noam Chomsky noting in a filmed Q&A session in 1989 that Lenin and the Bolsheviks were [viewed as a deviation by most orthodox Marxists](https://youtu.be/yQsceZ9skQI?t=130) due to their vanguardist tactics, as opposed to a more spontaneous revolution), it wasn't as pronounced or stark as 'Bolshevik or Anti-Bolshevik.'

Furthermore, the quote implies that it was only the Bolsheviks who advocated a violent revolution. While they did, as previously stated, believe in fomenting revolutions opportunistically, they were far from the only ones who supported it. Considering Marx wrote that ""The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself... not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons"", violent revolution was kinda a mainstay of most Marxist influenced forms of Communism.

Finally, this one's probably just a writing error and not actual bad history, but the narrator says that the ""Bolsheviks distanced themselves from the Communists"", despite the fact that he previously just said the Bolsheviks *became* the Communists (which is also another thing, as Bolshevik and Communist aren't synonymous)

Moving on from that, at 2:19, the narrator states ""Because of the actions of Mao and Stalin, socialists had to move away from Marx's ideas, which is why in European nations, socialist ideas blended in different variations with capitalist societies."" Two things with this. First of all, socialists did not move away from Marx's ideas after Mao and Stalin, or at least not all of them. Many [remained supporters of their regimes, despite their violent actions](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/08/what-exactly-are-trots-and-tankies), although they were, and still are, routinely decried by other socialists who disagree with the actions of Stalin and Mao. After all, socialists are humans, not a hive-mind - they won't all have the same interpretations or beliefs.

Secondly, the socialists that did move didn't move away from Marx's ideas - they moved away from Lenin's. Neil McInnes details in *The Western Marxists* that, in the aftermath of the Prague Spring, many European Communists migrated from the writings of Lenin to the writings of Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, who stressed that political change follows cultural change. This strain of Communist though became known as 'Eurocommunism'.

The next minute or so is a detail of the alternate history itself, which is obviously speculation that I can't really comment on. However, at 3:52, the narrator starts to dissect Fascism and its relationship to Communism.

At 3:55 the narrator states that ""Fascism actually has origins based on Marxism, and originally was a far-left movement, just like Communism."" According to *Fascism: A Very Short Introduction*, while it is true that Fascism has its roots in leftist thinkers like Georges Sorel, it would be inaccurate to call its early phase a ""far-left movement"", as one of the key tenets of Fascism, as pointed out by Benito Mussolini in *The Doctrine of Fascism* is it being ""the emphatic negation of that doctrine which constituted the basis of... Marxism: the doctrine of historical materialism."" Again, drawing from *Fascism: A Very Short Introduction*, while Fascism was more explicitly revolutionary in its early stages, it was never a 'far-left' movement.

At 4:01, the narrator continues by saying that ""Mussolini, after his rise to power, was heavily influenced by Marx."" This makes no sense as - as previously stated - Mussolini's Fascism was based primarily on a rejection of Communism. *Fascism: A Very Short Introduction* covers how Mussolini rode the coattails of a Red Scare (*Biennio Rosso*, in Italian) to power. The narrator then digs his hole a little deeper at 4:05 by backing up his claim by saying ""Both [Mussolini and Marx] believed in a revolution against the capitalists by the working class."" While many early Fascists did advocate revolution, Mussolini was not one of them. In fact, he would later turn his back on these early Fascists, spurning the leader of the Italian Communist Party, Palmiro Togliatti, to make his famous *Appeal to Brothers in Black Shirts*  and request so-called 'Fascists of the First Hour' to ""fight together"" with Communists ""for the realization of [some of the original Fascist beliefs]."" Furthermore, the claim about Mussolini being opposed to capitalists on behalf of the working class is just mind-boggling, as Mussolini himself pointed out in *The Doctrine of Fascism* that one of the reasons Fascism opposes Socialism is because the latter ""clings rigidly to class war.""

At 4:36, the narrator takes a detour to the other side of the globe while still staying in the land of badhistory - for badhistory knows no borders - by claiming; ""In Asia, without Communism, China's nationalists would immediately take over after the fall of the Emperor."" The problem with this is that, in our timeline, the nationalists *did* immediately take over after the fall of the Emperor... kind of. The nationalist Kuomintang held nominal power (**ETA: It has been pointed out to me that the Beiyang government held power before the Kuomintang, and were seen as legitimate**), [but most of the country was ruled by warlords](https://youtu.be/I5cl0GjPjy4?t=184) in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the Qing Dynasty, as pointed out in the PBS documentary *China: A Century of Revolution*. The Communists wouldn't register on anyone's radar for a few more years in China.

The badchinesehistory continues at 4:46, where the narrator fleshes out his alternate history by saying that in this alternate timeline, ""China is able to successfully fight off Japan."" That implies that China, you know, didn't successfully fight off Japan - which they did, as can be seen in the aforementioned documentary and the fact that China isn't ruled by Japan today.

After that, the rest of the video is just more detailing of the alternate timeline.",47,1527990151.0,8o27sb,False,"For those not in the know, AlternateHistoryHub is a Youtube channel that posts videos about, well, alternate histories.

There's quite a bit wrong with the video, including its analysis of Communism as an ideology in and of itself, but this is badhistory, not badpolitics, so I'll be sticking to criticizing the historical errors present.

The first slip occurs around 0:18, when the narrator says ""What if Communism was never invented? What if Karl Marx's ideas were simply never spread?"" The problem with this is that the ideology of Communism predates Karl Marx - or at least the label does. You don't have to look much further than the first line of the *Communist Manifesto* to figure that out: ""A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre is Communism"". That line wouldn't really make much sense if Marx himself invented Communism.

The next minute is just a brief rundown of Communism as an ideology and the history of it as a political system. At 1:16, however, the narrator states that ""Before the [Soviet Union], Marxists and Socialists had the same ideas."" Ummm... no.
Considering Marx devoted around a quarter of the *Communist Manifesto* to talking shit about other socialists and why their ideas are trash (specifically Section III ""Socialist and Communist Literature""), saying of 'Petty-Bourgeois Socialism': 

> ""Ultimately, when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all intoxicating effects of self-deception, this form of Socialism ended in a miserable fit of the blues.""

... it would be pretty inaccurate to state that 'Marxists and Socialist had the same ideas.' Hell, that's not even getting into the squabbles that were had in later decades (which I admittedly don't know enough to comment on).

At 1:53 though, is where things really kick into gear:

> ""At the end of World War I, socialists fell into two main camps with the start of the Russian Revolution: The Bolsheviks, later called Communists, were those who believed in a violent revolution to bring about Communist paradise, and the Anti-Bolsheviks; those who believed Socialism could evolve naturally into European political systems through democracy. After World War I, the Bolsheviks distanced themselves from the Communists gained influence, all through elections and not revolution.

Honestly I'm not even sure how to respond to this. While there was a notable split post-Russian Revolution - or rather, post Russian Civil War - about how Communists should react to the Bolsheviks taking power (with Noam Chomsky noting in a filmed Q&A session in 1989 that Lenin and the Bolsheviks were [viewed as a deviation by most orthodox Marxists](https://youtu.be/yQsceZ9skQI?t=130) due to their vanguardist tactics, as opposed to a more spontaneous revolution), it wasn't as pronounced or stark as 'Bolshevik or Anti-Bolshevik.'

Furthermore, the quote implies that it was only the Bolsheviks who advocated a violent revolution. While they did, as previously stated, believe in fomenting revolutions opportunistically, they were far from the only ones who supported it. Considering Marx wrote that ""The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself... not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons"", violent revolution was kinda a mainstay of most Marxist influenced forms of Communism.

Finally, this one's probably just a writing error and not actual bad history, but the narrator says that the ""Bolsheviks distanced themselves from the Communists"", despite the fact that he previously just said the Bolsheviks *became* the Communists (which is also another thing, as Bolshevik and Communist aren't synonymous)

Moving on from that, at 2:19, the narrator states ""Because of the actions of Mao and Stalin, socialists had to move away from Marx's ideas, which is why in European nations, socialist ideas blended in different variations with capitalist societies."" Two things with this. First of all, socialists did not move away from Marx's ideas after Mao and Stalin, or at least not all of them. Many [remained supporters of their regimes, despite their violent actions](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/08/what-exactly-are-trots-and-tankies), although they were, and still are, routinely decried by other socialists who disagree with the actions of Stalin and Mao. After all, socialists are humans, not a hive-mind - they won't all have the same interpretations or beliefs.

Secondly, the socialists that did move didn't move away from Marx's ideas - they moved away from Lenin's. Neil McInnes details in *The Western Marxists* that, in the aftermath of the Prague Spring, many European Communists migrated from the writings of Lenin to the writings of Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, who stressed that political change follows cultural change. This strain of Communist though became known as 'Eurocommunism'.

The next minute or so is a detail of the alternate history itself, which is obviously speculation that I can't really comment on. However, at 3:52, the narrator starts to dissect Fascism and its relationship to Communism.

At 3:55 the narrator states that ""Fascism actually has origins based on Marxism, and originally was a far-left movement, just like Communism."" According to *Fascism: A Very Short Introduction*, while it is true that Fascism has its roots in leftist thinkers like Georges Sorel, it would be inaccurate to call its early phase a ""far-left movement"", as one of the key tenets of Fascism, as pointed out by Benito Mussolini in *The Doctrine of Fascism* is it being ""the emphatic negation of that doctrine which constituted the basis of... Marxism: the doctrine of historical materialism."" Again, drawing from *Fascism: A Very Short Introduction*, while Fascism was more explicitly revolutionary in its early stages, it was never a 'far-left' movement.

At 4:01, the narrator continues by saying that ""Mussolini, after his rise to power, was heavily influenced by Marx."" This makes no sense as - as previously stated - Mussolini's Fascism was based primarily on a rejection of Communism. *Fascism: A Very Short Introduction* covers how Mussolini rode the coattails of a Red Scare (*Biennio Rosso*, in Italian) to power. The narrator then digs his hole a little deeper at 4:05 by backing up his claim by saying ""Both [Mussolini and Marx] believed in a revolution against the capitalists by the working class."" While many early Fascists did advocate revolution, Mussolini was not one of them. In fact, he would later turn his back on these early Fascists, spurning the leader of the Italian Communist Party, Palmiro Togliatti, to make his famous *Appeal to Brothers in Black Shirts*  and request so-called 'Fascists of the First Hour' to ""fight together"" with Communists ""for the realization of [some of the original Fascist beliefs]."" Furthermore, the claim about Mussolini being opposed to capitalists on behalf of the working class is just mind-boggling, as Mussolini himself pointed out in *The Doctrine of Fascism* that one of the reasons Fascism opposes Socialism is because the latter ""clings rigidly to class war.""

At 4:36, the narrator takes a detour to the other side of the globe while still staying in the land of badhistory - for badhistory knows no borders - by claiming; ""In Asia, without Communism, China's nationalists would immediately take over after the fall of the Emperor."" The problem with this is that, in our timeline, the nationalists *did* immediately take over after the fall of the Emperor... kind of. The nationalist Kuomintang held nominal power (**ETA: It has been pointed out to me that the Beiyang government held power before the Kuomintang, and were seen as legitimate**), [but most of the country was ruled by warlords](https://youtu.be/I5cl0GjPjy4?t=184) in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the Qing Dynasty, as pointed out in the PBS documentary *China: A Century of Revolution*. The Communists wouldn't register on anyone's radar for a few more years in China.

The badchinesehistory continues at 4:46, where the narrator fleshes out his alternate history by saying that in this alternate timeline, ""China is able to successfully fight off Japan."" That implies that China, you know, didn't successfully fight off Japan - which they did, as can be seen in the aforementioned documentary and the fact that China isn't ruled by Japan today.

After that, the rest of the video is just more detailing of the alternate timeline.",0,"For those not in the know, AlternateHistoryHub is a Youtube channel that posts videos about, well, alternate histories.

"So after playing and loving Rune Factory 4 I was in the mood for a more dedicated farming sim. I had never played a traditional Harvest Moon type game until Trio of Towns. The strict time management of past games scared me off from ever playing them. When I read Trio of Towns was much more laid back I decided to take a chance, I am so thankful that I did.

This game has become one of my top 5 favorite 3DS games. While Rune Factory 4 has better characters in my own opinion, Trio of Towns has hooked me much more then RF4 did. My main complaint is that the game is slow to start. Once you get past the initial hand holding everything just gets better and better. You go from slowly managing a small farm and connecting with your first town to being a part of three separate towns and managing a much bigger life. This may seem contradicting to my time management issues of past games but Trio of Towns makes things so much easier.

Crops and animals are very simple to manage. The quick menu mapped to the R button gives you access to anything you need without having to keep pausing the game. You can even cook food that slows down time and makes you move faster. (Farm those Adzuki beans in soft soil and cook Anpan Sweet rolls for easy time slowing food) Managing a huge farm with 10+ animals, multiple crops, a pet and a underground cellar can all be managed easily while still having more then enough time to explore each town and visit the townspeople everyday. The game may be very simple but it's simplicity is one of it's greatest strengths.

The game has 6 bachelor's and bachelorette's to choose from (7 if you get the dlc) and many unique townspeople to interact with, each with their own story events. There are also a variety of festivals to take part in throughout the year. Each town has their own unique festivals in respect to the nationality of the town. There are tons of clothes to tailor, house upgrades and remodels to choose from and farm layout pieces to make as well. Overall there is a ton to do and more fun to be had outside of just farming in this game.

In generaI wanted to share my experience with the game with others on this subreddit. If you have been on the fence with this game seriously consider giving it a try. I am so happy I pulled the trigger with this game and I am already looking foward to a second playthrough (over 100 hours on my current file). This type of game may seem daunting but Trio of Towns is incredibly beginner friendly, it even has an easy mode for newcomers.

Some tips from me are:
http://fogu.com/sos2/   1. Use this link for an amazing guide that will tell you everything you need to know about the game

2. Don't worry about greeting people everyday. You don't lose affection in this game unless you litter. Also tapping the L button does a quick greet for anyone in the area.

3. The cellar is unaffected by weather. Summer and Winter have storms that can damage and destroy crops. Beat the 3 lists of farming tips to gain access to your cellar. Then you can plant fruit trees that take a lot of time to fully grow.

4. Get a pet with a ""herding"" ability ASAP. This will make your pet bring animals out automatically in the morning and bring them back into the barn in the evening. The amount of animals this effects is based on your pet's skill level. Until you can purchase the bell in the second year this is extremely helpful. You have to manually take animals outside. Big animals require you to push them out which can be extremely frustrating when trying to steer them out the barn door.

5. Lisette is the best girl. Don't listen to others about Kasumi.

Sorry for the long post. I hope this might help someone else with a purchase.",17,1528006714.0,8o42d0,False,"So after playing and loving Rune Factory 4 I was in the mood for a more dedicated farming sim.

"So about 3 years ago when I was 18 or so, I was using Grindr and someone messaged me. For convenience, this lovely gentleman shall be referred to Rando.

So we started talking and we asked how we were and what we were up to, the usual conversation starters. Shortly after beginning the conversation, Rando began to sound rather depressing, bemoaning about his insecurities and how everyone hates him, occasionally talking about how he should just kill himself.

So, being the nice person that I am, I try finding something about him I could compliment on, try to make him feel better, that sort of thing, or bring a smile at the least and that's where things began to get heavy.

Rando began deflecting my compliments, calling me a liar or a user or saying I'm just trying to make fun of him. I tried my best to reassure him that my compliments were genuine because I hate seeing people depressed or down, it's just in my nature to bring joy to people. Now, I have been in his shoes before with the severe insecurity thing so I know how he felt.

After he finally began to believe that my compliments were real, he began to get very attached to me, started sending me over 20 messages at once and if I didn't reply within 5 seconds, he'd start to be like ""Oh I guess you found someone better to talk to then. You're like all the rest"" and it began to get frustrating at this point. Now, I could have just blocked him and saved me the headache but I have anxiety and I feared that he'd turn up at my door someday and do something drastic if I did block him.

He also tried sending me nudes to grab my attention when I didn't reply literally instantly to his messages and it got worse and worse from here. Eventually, he told me he'd be in my town over the weekend and began to get very pushy about meeting up somewhere and doing abject things. When I didn't reply, he flips out and started finding me on different social medias to keep tabs on me, Facebook messages, friend requests, Instagram follows etc.

I went out on a night out with some friends of mine at the time forgetting he was in town over the weekend and he saw me walking down the street and he ran up to me, balling his eyes out about me trying to avoid him and he began begging for my phone number and house address and whether he could join us on our night out and when we politely refused, he followed us further and tried forcing drinks in to my hand when we got to the bar.

Infuriated by how clingy he was being, I went home just to realise he boarded the same bus as me and followed me back to my place before he finally disappeared. He started messaging me on Grindr about visiting me at home sometime or trying to find my friends to get my phone number. I finally snapped at this point and finally blocked him and I thought that was that.

Only to discover the next day he was trying to catfish me with my own pictures to try and get my attention and screaming to know why I blocked him. At this point, things got way too heavy and I deleted Grindr from my phone, changed my number and moved house just to avoid him.

This whole experience has really put me off dating people with severe insecurities out of fear that something like this will occur again and I've been trying to go against my nature to avoid complimenting people too much to avoid something like this happening again. 3 years later, I haven't seen him since.

" I think about this a lot. How everyone’s choice around you growing up dictates the life you’ll live when you’re older. Here’s a weird coincidence. 
*Long story short* *very small details*
I’ve had the same best friend since I was 14. When we went to the same junior high, (we were in different grade levels) people would always mistake us for each other but we didn’t even know each other. 
A year later, she’s in high school and I’m still in junior high. My dad met this woman online who would later become my step mom and bring along 3 kids who become my siblings. 
The older son, I’ll call him Link, meets my (soon to be best friend who looks just like me) in the high school and they devolved crushes for another. I see him chatting with her on MySpace at home and become interested in knowing her myself. (I didn’t know this was the girl I always got mistaken for in school) 
I message her about a band she posted about and we bond over a shared interest in the same music genre. She finds out I’m actually her crushes step sister. Of course, she wants to have a slumber party with me! 
We eventually figure out we’re the girls that always got mistaken for another. We’re best friends now. 
We know everything about each other and here is where it gets weird to me. 
I originally grew up in the place she ORIGINALLY started school. (To keep it basic) we both moved around a lot due to our families. We were never in that town at the same time, but we both went to schools in that district. I feel like the universe dragged us together, by my dad meeting my step mom online who brought my step brother into my life who brought my soulmate best friend into my life. BUT, if we both stayed in our original school district, would we have collided there? We still ended up in a second same school district, but actually in the same school. I feel like if the series of events that played out didn’t happen the way they did, it’s possible we would always have been near each other without ever interacting. 
Edit: I met my current boyfriend only because of the same older step brother. (He is 4 years older than me, and they became best friends in a science class.) if it wasn’t for my step brother coming into my life because of our parents meeting online, I wouldn’t have ever met my boyfriend due to our ages we would have never met in high school let alone know each other existed. (We’ve been together for 6 years and we live together now.) *Edit; another sliver of weird info* I was in the room when my dad was online and saw my future step mom was live online. He really wanted to message her, but was intimidated (*shes too out of my league!*) my dad left the room and my oldest biological brother sat down and sent her a “hey” for him. My dad came back, nervous... and you know how that story ends. *ANOTHER COOL PIECE OF INFO THE BEST FRIEND WANTS ME TO ADD* SHE is the direct person WHO set me up with my boyfriend. I know I said I met him cause of my step brother (which I did at age 13 or 14) but ironically, my best friend was ALSO close with my now boyfriend. What a funny little world we live inside.

"This time last year I really hated being trans. I couldn't feel pride, because my ""trans experience"" was defined by dysphoria, rejection, loneliness, and fear. Seeing other trans people express their pride felt like a mockery.

But when I left home for college, my life changed all at once. I went to art school \- something I likely wouldn't have done if I were born a cis dude, since my circumstances would have dragged me toward a less creative field. My friends now are not only trans as well, they are the kindest people I've met in the world. They all went through that cold, awful, lonely part of life too, but it made them warmer. I can only hope it did the same to me.

If you can't feel pride this month, it's ok. You don't have to. But if it's any consolation, remember that loneliness breeds wisdom. The reason you feel alone is that you understand something that no one else around you can grasp. You'll break out of that in time \- you'll find others, and when you do, your capacity for empathy and kindness will be oceans deeper than those who never went through it.

"This didn't happen to me but i watched it happen via the camera system we have that monitors the back gate of the community i work at. At the front gate we just see what is going on and not the audio, what was said was filled in when the guard came to the front gate to drop off paperwork.

The back gate closes at 7:30pm on the dot every day. It has an automatic motor attached to the residents side of the gate and at 7:30pm the timer goes off, gate arms go up, and the huge metal (and friggin heavy i might add) gate rolls out to close off the residents side. The exit side is a tad smaller and does not have a motor to assist in closing and must be closed manually.

On this day the automatic gate starts doing its thing and closing the entrance side gate. At roughly 7:05pm the guard is in the process of locking the pedestrian gate a resident comes to the gate and sees it is closing, backs up, and comes in through the exit side. The guard sees it and knows exactly who it was and planned on reporting it to management. He finishes locking the pedestrian gate and is about to go to the exit gate and close it when a resident who was walking their dog comes up all in a huff and begins to berate him for letting someone come in after hours and that he will be at the office in the morning to complain that he is ""just letting people in"" and ""ill have you fired for this!""

The officer is the type who has been through a lot and having someone yell at him is equal to a fly buzzing around his head...annoying but nothing to stress out about. The ultimate no f*cks given attitude. 

He is a good officer and smart. He stood where the cameras could see him and the resident to make sure it was all captured. The resident berates him for 20 minutes about doing his job correctly and bla bla bla. The guard just stood there and took it. When the resident finally felt he said enough he walked away and the officer finally was able to close the exit gate...20 minutes late. 

The next day the officer was told that a resident has complained that he was letting people come in un-monitored after the normal gate closing time and they were reviewing the cameras. He did explain that he did have a resident come in the exit gate while he was locking the pedestrian gate the day before and that he also documented on his report that fact and also documented the ID of who the resident was.

Fast forward to 7:30pm that day and the officer is closing the gates now. He gets the pedestrian gate locked as the automatic gate is closing the entrance gate. Once hes done with the pedestrian gate he starts to pull the manual exit gate closed. He gets it about 3/4th the way closed when a car comes speeding up to the entrance side gate and begins to honk their horn. The guard stops closing the exit gate (its blocked the exit side totally by now) to see who is honking when the car backs up and pulls to the exit side and again honks his horn. The guard walks to the car and low and behold its the same guy who gave him hell for ""just letting people in"".

The resident demanded he be let in but the officer explained that the gate is closed at 7:30pm and he would need to use the front gate. The resident was not having it at all and was screaming at him to let him in using the excuse ""you haven't even locked it yet so just let me in"". The guard smiled and said you are correct, i haven't finished locking it yet and turned back to the gate and finished locking it with a smile. He then waved to the resident and finished locking up the gatehouse.

By the time he arrived at the front gate to drop off his paperwork the resident had come through the front gate and just glared at the officer who smiled and waved again and added ""have a nice day!"".

Some people just have to be an ass.

I just need a place to organize my thoughts and feelings more than to engage in a discussion. I think a discussion would be nice too.



If you are not familiar, the Wheel of Time books were not finished by the original author. Robert Jordan passed away before he could finish the last entry in the series. The series was finished instead by Brandon Sanderson, who published the final entry as 3 books. I read the 1st and 2nd of those books as soon as they were released. I have had the final book, A Memory of Light, sitting on a shelf in my home for the last 5 years. I couldn't do it.



I enjoyed knowing the story wasn't yet over. I mean, I knew this book would be the end. The last words of the story were written. But if I didn't read them it wasn't over for me.



And now it is.



I first read the Eye of the World almost 20 years ago as a teenager. These books have been a part of me my entire adult life. I am having a hard time dealing with the fact that I wont get another one. To a lesser extent, I always feel this way when I finish a story. I have never felt it this strongly though. I wonder if part of this is me grieving Robert Jordan himself. A person that I have never met. Yet characters he created helped shape me into the person that I am today. Even the characters that survived the events of the series are lost to us now. We will never hear from them again.



I know the story ended the way Robert Jordan wanted it to. He authored the epilogue of the final book, and to my knowledge it was published unaltered. It was a perfect ending. That not to say that Sanderson's work on the final entry in the series was lacking. I could tell the differences between the two authors certainly. I am familiar with many of the modern fantasy authors and I can't think of anyone else more appropriate than Brandon Sanderson to finish telling Jordan's story.



I didn't read any of this work until I heard he was going to finish the Wheel of Time. I picked up the Mistborn series the next day. If you haven't read it I can't recommend it enough. It is some comfort knowing that even though one story has ended, there are so many more out there. I have every intention of reading my way though all of his work now.

"This is the story of the most irrational customer I have ever dealt with.

I've worked as a pharmacy tech for about 3 years now, working for a big chain. We have a system that calls patients automatically when their prescription is filled. This is a nice system, but some people don't enjoy it as much as others, as you are about to see.

About 2 months ago, I got a phone call from a customer. You know how, sometimes, the customer is already at a 10 on the pissed-off-scale before the conversation has even started? This lady was at an 11. The phone call went essentially like this (RL is rude lady, the customer, HT is me, a hapless tech):

**HT:** Hello, thank you for calling ___ pharmacy, this is HT, how can I help you?

**RL:** Take me off your fucking list!

**HT:** *pause* Uh... Hi.

**RL:** I said take me off your goddamned call list!

**HT:** Okay, you've been getting phone calls from us?

**RL:** What did I just say?! Why would I want you to take me off your list if I hadn't been getting phone calls?!

**HT:** Okay, well it's possible you just have a prescription ready, what's your last name?

**RL:** What? I'm not gonna give you my information!

**HT:** Well, I would love to look up your profile and find out why you've been receiving phone calls, but I can't do that unless I know who you are.

**RL:** I don't go to your fucking pharmacy! I don't even live in (state I live in). I live in (other state, a few hundred miles away)!

At this point, I had an idea of what had happened. A customer had probably gotten a new phone number, and this woman had received their old one, which was still on their profile. The patient gets a new script filled, the call goes to the old number (and therefore RL), which is apparently the worst thing anybody has ever done to another person.

**HT:** Well, here's what I think happened. You probably have one of our customer's old phone numbers, and -

**RL:** Do you speak English?! Take. Me. Off. Your. List.

**HT:** *deep breath* Okay, let me look up the profile associated with this phone number. What's your phone number?

**RL:** *loud scoff* Oh, so your automated system can call me, but you still need my phone number?! Is this a fucking scam?!

**HT:** No ma'am, I assure you that it is not. But I don't know what our automated system is doing, and I don't have any way to know who you are, at all. So I can't fix the problem unless I know. I just want to fix your problem, but I have no information to work from here.

**RL:** *rattles off her number*

I look the number up, and lo and behold, it's assigned to a regular customer who most definitely lives in our town. I go to delete the number, when realize I can push this woman a little further up the wall, all in the name of compliance.

**HT:** Okay, and what's your date of birth, ma'am?

**RL:** WHAT?! I already told you my phone number, why do you need my date of birth, do you want my fucking social security number too?!

**HT:** I need to make sure this isn't your account. 

At this point, she is *fuming.*

**RL:** I TOLD YOU IT'S NOT MY ACCOUNT! I DON'T FILL AT YOUR FUCKING PHARMACY!

**HT:** Ma'am, I understand your frustration, but I can't edit a customer's account without verifying that you aren't this person. And if I don't edit it, the phone calls won't stop.

**RL:** FINE! *rattles off date of birth*

**HT:** Great, looks like we had incorrect contact info. We'll get that changed, and the phone calls should stop. Can I help you with anything else today?

**RL:** GO FUCK YOURSELF!

**HT:** And have a wonderful afternoon, ma'am. Thank you for calling.

I debated leaving the phone number on the account for a few more weeks, but I decided that she seemed angry enough to come down here, so I deleted the phone number and went on with my day.

Working on a public roadmap for the website with various projects & priorities, interactive and updated.

He will assist IOTA with setting up an alliance. May hand over parts of the IOTA Foundation (projects) to Eclipse Foundation.

**Finance Partnerships:**
Interest in expanding IOTA into regular finance, not just M2M.
In the future there is no distinction between M2M/IoT and regular finance.

**Partners in Core Tech:**
Outside contributors requires governance, which is in place for the Foundation, but no official governance in place to manage externally provided code.
Open to indsutry submitting ideas and code for a global standard.

**Differences between IOTA in 2015 and now:**
On (almost) exact path that they set out to create, which is inevitable as they are pioneering the space (building the road).
Further ahead than they thought they would be.
Market cap, partners, etc exceeded expectations (at this early stage).
Rarely looking at how far they have come (bigger picture) as regularly looking to the next challenge.

**Swarm nodes:**
Swarm nodes on priority agenda for 2019.
CfB working on the intricacies of enabling these.
Won't need them until we see IoT adoption.

**Transactions:**
Goal to reach 1000 CTPS in 2018, prefer with organic adoption, rather than just under stress test.

**Identity:**
Working on it since 2015 (& still actively), identity layer for IoT and humans.
A fundamental building block for future projects.
Purpose of IF is to enable and create the basic building blocks to enable the machine economy.
How can I trust a charging station is a charging station? Identity is everywhere & important.
Blockchain (or Tangle) only a small part of an identity system (a mosaic used as a metaphor).
Has to be a collaboration effort (across industry, not just one Foundation), not all projects have been disclosed.
Internet of me, GDPR provides opportunity to hand over control of data to users for monetisation, etc.

**How The Team Works:**
The future of work, collaboration across the globe.
Completely distributed, decentralised team, working 24/7.
Tone of Foundation much more friendly than a regular company.
Bootstrapping under the eye of the public.
Create a technology with this sort of impact is the opportunity of a life time.
Dealing with attacks is stressful, emotional, a distraction at times, but the team is dedicated and works through the night when needed.
Productivity level in the team is beyond boundaries.
Every day there is new questions that can't be answered via Google or Stack Exchange, needing to invent solutions all the time and come up with new questions.
Not one leader, everyone is contributing to the vision and ecosystem. All in the IF have same perspective, all about ""getting shit done"".
IF in more than 15 countries, not just a German NFP.
David and Dom thrive in chaos. Exciting to see how committed everyone is.
Aiming to have IF at 100+ people by the end of the year.

**What Can Non-Techs Do To Contribute:**
Anyone can add value if you spend some time doing ""something"".
Example: Limo running the Tangle blog with Sunday YouTube rant, a valuable resource.
Answer questions on Reddit / Stack Exchange / GitHub.
Create blog posts, create content (content creators important for the ecosystem).
Some companies working with IF have been connected by random people in the community who happen to work there.
Find something that you can put energy into.
A person who has never heard about blockchain needs to know about how IOTA can help them.
Meetups are getting more important. Community can help to shape these, participate, innovate.
Huge opportunities for people to pursue careers in IOTA (developers in the space can earn good coin, etc).
Don't ask for permission to do something, ""just fucking do something"" :)
Impressed by the ecosystem every single day, seeing new projects they haven't heard of provides IF energy to keep going.

**FUD:**
IOTA has been attacked over and over by idiots.
IF are doing their best to create something new for the world.
Why the fuck is this happening?
Don't care anymore, they will avoid getting distracted, forget about the naysayers.
In the real world (corporate world), they are not seeing any resistance, only enthusiasm.
All of the nonsense comes from other crypto projects or those with close ties to them.
Focusing on real world adoption, all that matters.
Getting better on focusing on work, getting shit done.
Takes courage from the corporate partners (among the most conservative and largest in the world) to join IOTA, they are aware of the FUD from the crypto outlets.
The corporates want to work with IOTA, they ignore the FUD.
The FUD is beyond ridiculous. IF have to correct some of the lies, but the rest is ignored.
It's the ultimate compliment that others have to go out of their way to tarnish IOTA with complete fabrications.

**Social Problems:**
Next stage: want to apply the tech to true social problems.
Want to partner with NGOs and other organisations e.g. tech to support refugees, unbanked, etc.
No specific ideology/neutral as a Foundation, not supporting left / right / centre politics. Just creating the voting mechanism.

**Final:**
They miss regular contact with the community & want to host these regularly, perhaps monthly.

"I want to talk to you about some of the most important lessons I've learnt over the years of approaching thousands of women. These are the lessons I’ve learned from countless rejections, as well as many amazing experiences with beautiful women. 

I literally transformed myself from shy and awkward around women, to developing the confidence and skills that allow me to never have to worry about women ever again.

Here's what I learnt.

=========================================

TIP #1: IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU

=========================================

Remember that being successful with women starts in your own mind. 

You can have the best openers and a great sense of style, but if your mindset is weak, if you don't think highly of yourself, you're always going to struggle.

You need to understand that women are absolutely amazing reading guys. How you perceive yourself will be very apparent in your nonverbal communication, and if what you say doesn't match your nonverbals, you might as well turn around and go home. 

They'll pick up on that in an instant, and the moment they do, they'll lose interest in you, so you must have a high opinion of yourself so that your body language works for you and not against you.

=========================================

TIP #2: Change Your Environment

=========================================

Do you remember, when you're a small kid, you thought nothing was impossible? If you had an idea, you went for it. If you failed, it didn't matter. You just started over. 

After a while, though, your environment started telling you that you can't do this, that or the other thing, and after a while you started to believe them. This then made you form limiting beliefs about yourself and your capabilities as a person. 

Your environment shaped you. 

The good news is, that this works both ways. If you want to be someone who is confident and great with women, you need to surround yourself with people that will help you become that. 

You need who you surround yourself with, your environment, to share your vision.

Over the years as a mentor I discovered that you need help from people that push you in the right direction and help you become who you want to be. That's just one of the things I do with the guys I take under my wing, but it's so crucial.

 
=========================================

TIP #3: Massive Action Quickly

=========================================

This one is going to be completely obvious to some of you, and completely new to others. 

The truth is, that you can sit there and think about approaches, openers, strategies and tactics, but if you don't put yourself out there and implement what you learn, it'll be a waste of time.

When I look at the guys that I taught that were extremely successful, I see one thing that they all have in common. 

They took massive action on what I told them to do, and they did it quickly. 
 
In order to be successful you have to take massive action, and you have to do it as fast as you possibly can.

Forget all your excuses, take massive action, and you'll see you'll be tremendously successful in no time. 

=========================================

TIP #4: Your Reason Why 

=========================================

Having said all that about taking action, there's one thing I need to mention to you. 

You don't want to just work hard. You need to also work smart.

It's not enough to take action. You need the right plan, the right set of strategies and tactics that will get you where you want to be. 

Define your reasons why you want to be successful with women, and become laser focused. 

Do you want to meet a girl that you want to have a long term relationship with, or are you looking for a hook up?

Do you want someone that will nurture you, or are you more interested in a no-strings-attached relationship?

Whatever your reasons are, you have to clearly define them, because your end goal will determine how you're going to get there. 

You're not going to treat someone you're hooking up with for the night the same as someone you want to spend the rest of your life with, right?

Once your goal is defined, you have to figure out how to get there.",11,1528001146.0,8o3gx2,False,"I want to talk to you about some of the most important lessons I've learnt over the years of approaching thousands of women.

The good news is, that this works both ways. If you want to be someone who is confident and great with women, you need to surround yourself with people that will help you become that. 

You need who you surround yourself with, your environment, to share your vision.

Over the years as a mentor I discovered that you need help from people that push you in the right direction and help you become who you want to be. That's just one of the things I do with the guys I take under my wing, but it's so crucial.

 
=========================================

TIP #3: Massive Action Quickly

=========================================

This one is going to be completely obvious to some of you, and completely new to others. 

The truth is, that you can sit there and think about approaches, openers, strategies and tactics, but if you don't put yourself out there and implement what you learn, it'll be a waste of time.

When I look at the guys that I taught that were extremely successful, I see one thing that they all have in common. 

They took massive action on what I told them to do, and they did it quickly. 
 
In order to be successful you have to take massive action, and you have to do it as fast as you possibly can.

Forget all your excuses, take massive action, and you'll see you'll be tremendously successful in no time. 

=========================================

TIP #4: Your Reason Why 

=========================================

Having said all that about taking action, there's one thing I need to mention to you. 

You don't want to just work hard. You need to also work smart.

It's not enough to take action. You need the right plan, the right set of strategies and tactics that will get you where you want to be. 

Define your reasons why you want to be successful with women, and become laser focused. 

Do you want to meet a girl that you want to have a long term relationship with, or are you looking for a hook up?

Do you want someone that will nurture you, or are you more interested in a no-strings-attached relationship?

Whatever your reasons are, you have to clearly define them, because your end goal will determine how you're going to get there. 

You're not going to treat someone you're hooking up with for the night the same as someone you want to spend the rest of your life with, right?

Once your goal is defined, you have to figure out how to get there.",0,"I want to talk to you about some of the most important lessons I've learnt over the years of approaching thousands of women. These are the lessons I’ve learned from countless rejections, as well as many amazing experiences with beautiful women. 

I literally transformed myself from shy and awkward around women, to developing the confidence and skills that allow me to never have to worry about women ever again.

Here's what I learnt.

=========================================

TIP #1: IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU

=========================================

Remember that being successful with women starts in your own mind. 

You can have the best openers and a great sense of style, but if your mindset is weak, if you don't think highly of yourself, you're always going to struggle.

You need to understand that women are absolutely amazing reading guys. How you perceive yourself will be very apparent in your nonverbal communication, and if what you say doesn't match your nonverbals, you might as well turn around and go home. 

They'll pick up on that in an instant, and the moment they do, they'll lose interest in you, so you must have a high opinion of yourself so that your body language works for you and not against you.

=========================================

TIP #2: Change Your Environment

=========================================

Do you remember, when you're a small kid, you thought nothing was impossible? If you had an idea, you went for it. If you failed, it didn't matter. You just started over. 

After a while, though, your environment started telling you that you can't do this, that or the other thing, and after a while you started to believe them. This then made you form limiting beliefs about yourself and your capabilities as a person.

"Freija spent most of her time with Aldr. Like most of the Dreadnoughts, he’d been stationed at Borek’s Seal and now waited grumpily for action. When the enemy came, his guns would be at the forefront, thrust into the inferno again with those of his battle-brothers.

‘So what’s it like?’ Freija asked him, chewing on a tough ribbon of dried meat during a rest period.

**What’s what like?**

‘Having your armour fussed over,’ she said. ‘Can you feel a touch on it, like skin?’

Freija could sense when she’d irritated him. She didn’t know how – there were no facial cues, after all – but the impression was definite enough.

**Your curiosity. Your lack of respect. Where does it come from?**

Freija grinned at the Dreadnought’s annoyance. She felt no aura of intimidation from Aldr. Despite his vast killing potential, far in excess of even the Jarl, his moods were strangely immature, and she’d become intrigued by him in a way that she could never have done with a living Blood Claw.

‘My mother. She came from the ice, and passed on its crude ways.’

As she spoke, Freija recalled her face. Heavy-set like hers, blonde hair in messy curls, a tight mouth that rarely smiled, features made harsh by unremitting labour and hardship. But the eyes, the dark, sparkling eyes – they had exposed the bright intellect within, the questioning, rebellious soul that had never quite been ground down. Even at the end, when the punishing demands of the Sky Warriors had exacerbated the illness that would kill her, those eyes had remained alive and inquiring.

**You should learn to control it.**

‘I know,’ she said wearily. ‘It leads to damnation.’

**Indeed it does.**

After a while, Aldr shifted heavily on his central drive-column.

**It feels like being alive, and yet not alive. When something touches my armour, I sense it more closely than I could when a living warrior. My eyesight is sharper, my hearing more acute, my muscles more powerful for being plasfibre and ceramite. Everything is more immediate. And yet...**

Freija looked at the Dreadnought’s face-plate. The slit in the armour was dark, an opaque well into the ruined corpse within. Though there were no visual signals, no possibility of facial expression, she could feel his misery as acutely as if he’d been weeping. For an instant, she caught the image of a Blood Claw racing across the wind-blasted ice, his blades whirling, long hair streaming, caught up in the feral joy of his calling.

**It will never be like that again.**

‘I’m sorr–’

"For those of you who will be joining us again in the fall, I was hoping I could get a message through about introspection. 

For many students currently going through undergrad, the narrative has been this: our parents either went to college or recognized the college\-to\-workforce pipeline of the 1990s and 2000s, and, meaning the best for their children, emphasized the importance of higher education in the modern economy. Many go to university before they even know what their major is. Gen\-eds take two years anyway, so the rush isn't immense. But you basically jump into the ocean and learn how to swim sometime thereafter. Selecting a major is a daunting task; you're at a 100\-way intersection where few streets ever meet again, and at age 18 you're being asked to pick a road to travel down. As graduation approaches, you may question whether you've chosen the right road, and if you didn't, you'd like to travel back and pick a different one before it's too late.

There are some common negative effects that come about with higher education. The mounting debt forces urgency. The parental and/or self\-imposed expectations force certainty. These two entities, when imparted simultaneously upon a stressed young adult, lead to errors. 

Please, while academics are on break, take some time to look inward. When it starts back up again, you'll have a new year of uncertainty of all different kinds to deal with. I want to outline a few major causes of stress, whether you consciously think about them or not:

* **Career Prospects:** As you near graduation, that college\-to\-workforce pipeline you were promised is probably nowhere to be seen. As it turns out, there is still uncertainty as to whether or not you're gonna ""make it."" Do some searching around. Identify reasonable career prospects that coincide with what you could see yourself enjoying, and what is reasonable attainable. The **Bureau of Labor Statistics** is a good resource for understanding a profession of interest. For example, if you are an economics undergrad, [the economist outlook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/economists.htm) on the BLS website explains what economists do, what the work environment is like, the path to becoming one, the pay / career outlook, data specific to your state, etc.. Find a career that is within the scope of your major and go down the rabbit hole. It'll show similar occupations and you can get lost in the possibilities. The point is, *knowing* what these possibilities are takes away fear's greatest resource: uncertainty. Pave different scenarios for yourself. Have contingency plans. 
* **Debt:** If you are not 100&#37; certain that you enjoy your major or that it will lead to good pay, this problem's stress effect magnifies considerably. While it's a tall order to be 100&#37; certain that you enjoy what you're doing \(nobody is\), it is much more clear whether or not your degree leads to the bucks to make it up. Again, referring to the BLS website, you can identify very rough pay trajectories. You're in an ocean of debt and are told that if you swim long enough, the labor force will through you a life raft and you'll skirt by to success. While that may be true eventually, it's hard to believe it in the moment. Identify how finances are going to play out after graduation. See what kind of salary you need to make ends meet given the loan repayments; chances are the first few years will be rough, but it can be done. There are university resources \(namely people\) who will sit and listen to your post\-graduation plans and your concerns about your outlook. Use them. Knowing that you're not automatically headed for Fuckville after graduation and that you do have hope will make all the difference. 
* **Endgame academics:** As graduation semester approaches, you will likely be doing larger and more serious undertakings in place of remedial lower\-course homework assignments and 5 page papers. Exams may become more intense and of course the expectations imposed upon you will be raised. Together, these elements may make you question whether or not you really enjoy the subject matter. Know this: even the most passionate PhD student will question their passion in the heart of entrance examinations. The entire point is to have your passion questioned; if it fails the challenge, your passion was misplaced and you'll be better for not following it to its bitter end. If you survive even the most obnoxious capstone defense, you'll know if you're in the right place. But don't feel that your heart is betraying you if you suddenly see your passion wane; you're jaded and just want to graduate and start working. If you are excited for the future, use that energy to feed you during these dark times. Know that your resolve is being tested to make you stronger; if you survive discouragement, your confidence will skyrocket.
* **Sunk costs:** You've been in your program for awhile now. If you drop out or change programs, you'll bear the frustration of yourself, your family, and your close friends. These pressures and expectations may convince you that remaining in a place wherein you're unhappy is in your best interests, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Don't ever think that you're trapped into finishing a degree you don't like. You aren't going to enjoy it some days / weeks / months, but feeling trapped is only going to exacerbate your desire to be free, and this may push you to leave a program that you may actually enjoy.
* **Interpersonal comparisons:** Others around you are landing exciting internships, graduating early, acing their projects, or changing majors and finding happiness infinitely easier to come by. You may not have enjoyed any of these events. I hope this mostly goes without saying, but comparing yourself to how the lives of others are going is almost entirely counterproductive. I don't want to elaborate on this point too much; as you can see above, there are many other things for you to worry about. The luck and success of others does not dictate what lies ahead for you.
* **Social life:** Most people can handle a bad grade on an exam. Some are well\-tempered and can handle an academic probation semester. Others can plow through a degree without ever caring a second about their career prospects, trusting the process, and just ending up stupidly lucky. But very few people are equipped to handle the pain of having nobody to talk to. This stress will eat at you, whether you call yourself an ""introvert"" who loves nothing more than a book and a quiet rainy evening, or you're a party animal who just can't find parties to go to. **Developing your social life, and more directly, your emotional / mental well\-being is the most important project you will ever complete as an undergraduate.** Now, many have gotten through the system without having a stable group of friends. Many simply don't need to party every weekend and the conversations they have with classmates about school gets them by just fine. Know yourself; if not having friends bothers you, it needs to be taken just as seriously as any other problem in life.

Many students over the course of the year will make posts about how they hate their major / just aren't feeling the whole college thing. Please take advantage of the time you have to plan for yourself and tackle your own fears. There are some things you will not be able to solve, like the fear of getting a job / internship, the fear of getting a scholarship, etc.. There are these exogenous factors which are beyond your control. The best that you can do is take care of the things you can control \- such as your own understanding of career trajectories, or how you plan to manage the stress of endgame academics.

Others can plow through a degree without ever caring a second about their career prospects, trusting the process, and just ending up stupidly lucky. But very few people are equipped to handle the pain of having nobody to talk to. This stress will eat at you, whether you call yourself an ""introvert"" who loves nothing more than a book and a quiet rainy evening, or you're a party animal who just can't find parties to go to. **Developing your social life, and more directly, your emotional / mental well\-being is the most important project you will ever complete as an undergraduate.** Now, many have gotten through the system without having a stable group of friends. Many simply don't need to party every weekend and the conversations they have with classmates about school gets them by just fine. Know yourself; if not having friends bothers you, it needs to be taken just as seriously as any other problem in life.

Many students over the course of the year will make posts about how they hate their major / just aren't feeling the whole college thing. Please take advantage of the time you have to plan for yourself and tackle your own fears. There are some things you will not be able to solve, like the fear of getting a job / internship, the fear of getting a scholarship, etc.. There are these exogenous factors which are beyond your control. The best that you can do is take care of the things you can control \- such as your own understanding of career trajectories, or how you plan to manage the stress of endgame academics.

Hang tough, and look inward.",0,"For those of you who will be joining us again in the fall, I was hoping I could get a message through about introspection. 

For many students currently going through undergrad, the narrative has been this: our parents either went to college or recognized the college\-to\-workforce pipeline of the 1990s and 2000s, and, meaning the best for their children, emphasized the importance of higher education in the modern economy. Many go to university before they even know what their major is. Gen\-eds take two years anyway, so the rush isn't immense. But you basically jump into the ocean and learn how to swim sometime thereafter. Selecting a major is a daunting task; you're at a 100\-way intersection where few streets ever meet again, and at age 18 you're being asked to pick a road to travel down. As graduation approaches, you may question whether you've chosen the right road, and if you didn't, you'd like to travel back and pick a different one before it's too late.

There are some common negative effects that come about with higher education. The mounting debt forces urgency. The parental and/or self\-imposed expectations force certainty. These two entities, when imparted simultaneously upon a stressed young adult, lead to errors. 

Please, while academics are on break, take some time to look inward. When it starts back up again, you'll have a new year of uncertainty of all different kinds to deal with. I want to outline a few major causes of stress, whether you consciously think about them or not:

* **Career Prospects:** As you near graduation, that college\-to\-workforce pipeline you were promised is probably nowhere to be seen. As it turns out, there is still uncertainty as to whether or not you're gonna ""make it."" Do some searching around. Identify reasonable career prospects that coincide with what you could see yourself enjoying, and what is reasonable attainable. The **Bureau of Labor Statistics** is a good resource for understanding a profession of interest. For example, if you are an economics undergrad, [the economist outlook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/economists.htm) on the BLS website explains what economists do, what the work environment is like, the path to becoming one, the pay / career outlook, data specific to your state, etc.. Find a career that is within the scope of your major and go down the rabbit hole. It'll show similar occupations and you can get lost in the possibilities. The point is, *knowing* what these possibilities are takes away fear's greatest resource: uncertainty. Pave different scenarios for yourself. Have contingency plans. 
* **Debt:** If you are not 100&#37; certain that you enjoy your major or that it will lead to good pay, this problem's stress effect magnifies considerably. While it's a tall order to be 100&#37; certain that you enjoy what you're doing \(nobody is\), it is much more clear whether or not your degree leads to the bucks to make it up. Again, referring to the BLS website, you can identify very rough pay trajectories. You're in an ocean of debt and are told that if you swim long enough, the labor force will through you a life raft and you'll skirt by to success. While that may be true eventually, it's hard to believe it in the moment. Identify how finances are going to play out after graduation. See what kind of salary you need to make ends meet given the loan repayments; chances are the first few years will be rough, but it can be done. There are university resources \(namely people\) who will sit and listen to your post\-graduation plans and your concerns about your outlook. Use them. Knowing that you're not automatically headed for Fuckville after graduation and that you do have hope will make all the difference. 
* **Endgame academics:** As graduation semester approaches, you will likely be doing larger and more serious undertakings in place of remedial lower\-course homework assignments and 5 page papers. Exams may become more intense and of course the expectations imposed upon you will be raised. Together, these elements may make you question whether or not you really enjoy the subject matter. Know this: even the most passionate PhD student will question their passion in the heart of entrance examinations. The entire point is to have your passion questioned; if it fails the challenge, your passion was misplaced and you'll be better for not following it to its bitter end. If you survive even the most obnoxious capstone defense, you'll know if you're in the right place. But don't feel that your heart is betraying you if you suddenly see your passion wane; you're jaded and just want to graduate and start working. If you are excited for the future, use that energy to feed you during these dark times. Know that your resolve is being tested to make you stronger; if you survive discouragement, your confidence will skyrocket.
* **Sunk costs:** You've been in your program for awhile now. If you drop out or change programs, you'll bear the frustration of yourself, your family, and your close friends. These pressures and expectations may convince you that remaining in a place wherein you're unhappy is in your best interests, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Don't ever think that you're trapped into finishing a degree you don't like. You aren't going to enjoy it some days / weeks / months, but feeling trapped is only going to exacerbate your desire to be free, and this may push you to leave a program that you may actually enjoy.
* **Interpersonal comparisons:** Others around you are landing exciting internships, graduating early, acing their projects, or changing majors and finding happiness infinitely easier to come by. You may not have enjoyed any of these events. I hope this mostly goes without saying, but comparing yourself to how the lives of others are going is almost entirely counterproductive. I don't want to elaborate on this point too much; as you can see above, there are many other things for you to worry about. The luck and success of others does not dictate what lies ahead for you.
* **Social life:** Most people can handle a bad grade on an exam. Some are well\-tempered and can handle an academic probation semester. Others can plow through a degree without ever caring a second about their career prospects, trusting the process, and just ending up stupidly lucky. But very few people are equipped to handle the pain of having nobody to talk to.

"[IN PROGRESS]

&nbsp;

**Important observation:** The calculations were made based on the assumption that within the same quest tier (1 star, 2star, etc ...) the odds are split equally. For example, the chance of getting a 4-star scroll quest would be the same as getting a 4-star gem quest.

&nbsp;

This fact still needs to be proven by studying a large amount of data (which I have already begun to collect). As soon as I have something concrete I will give you feedback. Meanwhile I will move the ""status"" of the post to ""in progress""

**Introduction:**

The objective of this post is to analyze, based on the probability distribution, the result of 17 simulations of different scenarios with regard to the option of refresh in the tavern.

&nbsp;

A **scenario** is a rule you would follow when using the refresh option in the tavern.

* For example: refresh until all quests are 4star or more.

* For example: refresh until all quests are 5star or more, or 4star heroic scroll or 4 star gems.

* For example: refresh until all quests are 6star or more, or 5star heroic scroll, or 5star gems, or 4star heroic scroll, or 4star gems.

* For example: never refresh

* etc, etc ...

&nbsp;

The text is divided into the following **topics**:

1.  Complete explanation of one simulation case

2.  Results table of all simulations

1.  Discussion of results

1.  Special cases

**1. Complete explanation of one simulation case**

The rationale behind the calculations is that by refreshing a quest it tends to follow a distribution that according to wikia would be:

&nbsp;

Tier| Probability| | | |
---|---|----|---- | --- | 
1star | 25%| 3 - 5 gems| 1 basic scroll | 
2star | 27%| 6 - 10 gems| 2 basic scroll| ...
3star| 23%| 15 - 30 gems| ...| ...
4star | 15%| ...| ...| ...
5star | 8%| ...| ...| ...
6star | 1,6%| ...|... | ...
7star | 0,4%| ...|... |...

Source: http://idleheroes.wikia.com/wiki/Tavern

(Acess to view the full table)

&nbsp;

So, considering that within each quest tier  the odds are split equally, if I refresh 1000 quests, 250 will be 1star of which 125 will be gems which means receive 125 * 4 = 500 gems (using the average value (4 gems) of the range (3 to 5 gems)).

&nbsp;

That way, let's analyze what happens in the scenario that we decide to **refresh all the quests until they are 4star or more**. 

&nbsp;

Let's take a sample of 180 quests (1 month worth of quests if you get 6 quests per day (ie vip2 players)). The chance of a quest to be 4star or more is 15% + 8% + 1.6% + 0.4% = 25%. So by the time the 180 quests appear on your screen, 45 (25%) will be 4star or more and 135 (75%) will be 3 star or less. 

&nbsp;

This means that in your **first interaction** you will have 135 quests to refresh.

When you do the refresh, 33.75 (again 25%) will be quests 4star or more and 101.25 (again 75%) will be quests of 3star or less.

This means that in your **second interaction** you will have 101.25 quests to refresh.

&nbsp;

So, the total number of refreshs until all 180 quests are 4star or more is:

135 + 135x0.75 + 135x(0.75)^2 + 135x(0.75)^3 + .......

Do the math and the result will be 540.

&nbsp;

That is, **you will spend 5400 gems to have 180 quests of 4star or more.**

&nbsp;

Now let's look at what you get with these 180 quests, assuming again that they will follow the probability distribution and using the average values of the intervals.

&nbsp;


  Reward of 180 quests at 4star or more  | Quantities
-----------------------------------------|----------
Gem |    2643,8
Heroic Scroll |      44,6
Casino coin |      44,6
Arena ticket |      77,8
Prophet orb |       3,5
Prophet Branch |      144
4star shard |      296,6
5star shard |      18,1
Red artifact shard |      28,8
Green artifact shard |      69,1

&nbsp;

To convert this to gems I will use the following **reference table**:

&nbsp;



Item | Price in gems
----|-------------
Gem | 1
Heroic Scroll | 150
Casino Coin | 30
Arena ticket | 12
Prophet orb | 500
Prophet branch | 5
4star shard | not considered
5star shard | not considered
Red artifact shard | not considered
Green artifact shard  | not considered

&nbsp;

So with 180 quests of 4star or more you will get 14060 gems + 296 4star shard + 18 5star shards + 28 red artifact shard + 69 green artifact shard.

&nbsp;

Your **profit** will then be 14060 - 5400 = **8660 gems + the shards.**

&nbsp;


--

**2.  Result table of all scenario simulations**

Now following the same reasoning described in 1. (180 quests sample) we can make another 16 scenarios simulations and obtain the following table (ordened from the most to the lesser profitable):


&nbsp;



Scenario |  Profit  |  Gem spent daily* | Heroic Scroll gain
--------|--------|----------------|------------------
12. keep all 6star or more and 5 star scroll, gem, casino  and 4 star scroll quests |  12511,8  |  -419,3 |  113,9
13. keep all 6star+ and 5 star scroll, gem and 4 star scroll quests |  12495,1 |  -512,8 |  136,1
8. keep all 6star+ and 5 star scroll, gem ,casino  and 4 star scroll, gem quests |  12110 |  -236,6 |  87,2
10. keep all 6star+ and 5 star scroll, gem  and 4 star scroll, gem quests |  12040,8 |  -279,0 |  99,6
14. keep all 6star+ and 5 star scroll  and 4 star scroll quests |  11160 |  -782,5 |  169,1
7. keep all 6star+ and 5 star scroll, gem,shard,casino  and 4 star scroll, gem quests |  10965 |  -203,7 |  77,5
9. keep all 6star+ and 5 star scroll, gem, shard and 4 star scroll, gem quests |  10760,7 |  -236,6 |  87,2
11. keep all 6star+ and 5 star scroll, gem, shard  and 4 star scroll quests |  10748,6 |  -419,3 |  113,9
6. keep all 5star+ and 4star scroll, gem quests |  10696,5 |  -177,3 |   69,8
5. keep all 5star+ and 4star scroll, gem,cassino quests |  10144,4 |  -139,8 |  58,7
4. keep all 4star+ quests |   8660,2 |  -91,9 |  44,6
3. keep all 4star+ and 3star gem quests |  8134,7 |  -38,2 |  36,3
2. keep all 4star+ and all gem quests |   5948,3 |  16,2 |  21,4
1. never refresh |    4092 |  37,1 |  11,1
15. keep all 6star+ and 5 star scroll, gem quests |   3087,7 |  -843,2 |  110,8
16. keep all 6star+ and 5 star scroll quests |   -3540 | -1485,7  |  160
17. keep all 6star+ quests |  -51012 | -2720,4 |    0

**For full table please acess the spreadsheet link:** https://1drv.ms/x/s!AkGoX-l9tcfrgi53csVvxnych11c

*Gem spent daily is equal to the gem received (just gems, without items) minus the refresh cost, all divided by 30. So basically is the average quantity that you need to pay daily to create the scenario (considering you get 6 quests per day). If positive means you get gems instead of pay.

&nbsp;

Note that it would still be possible to imagine and simulate other scenarios, but I believe that I have taken the most important and relevant ones with regard to what will be analyzed.

&nbsp;

--

**3. Discussion of results**

As seen in the table above, **the best profit will be given by scenario 12** which requires an expense of 419 gems per day.

But in my opinion **the best cost-benefit is scenario 8**, which gives you a little less gems (12.1k instead of 12.5k) but requires a much lower cost (236 gems per day instead of 419 gems per day)

&nbsp;

It is very important also to note three things:

1. Although the tavern is the best investment of gems in the game you will probably still need to focus your spending on specific items to get the minimum amount to complete events, as well as having some gems in reserve to be able to buy unique offers. So it is important that you follow a scenario consistent with how much you can spend without harming your planning.
1. All table data is based on 6 quests per day during 1 month so if you have access to more or less than that you need to do the proportional calculation (just divide by 6 and multiply by your number of daily quests ).

1.  I did not do the calculation, but the use of quest scrolls will bring different results from the showed because at the moment of use they do not follow the probability distribution considered in the calculations here.

&nbsp;

With that said, the following table shows you **the best scenario for you based on how much you can spend on a daily basis:**

&nbsp;



   Quantity you can spent daily    |    Best scenario  | Profit
----------------------------------|------------------|------
420 or more gems |     12 |  12511,8 
up to 237 gems |      8 |  12110,0
up to 204 gems |      7 |  10965
up to 177 gems |      6 |  10696,5
up to 140 gems |      5 |  10144
up to 92 gems |      4 |  8660,2
up to 40 gems |      3 |  8134,7
nothing* |      2 |  5948,4

*on average.

&nbsp;

--

**1. Special cases**
  

While the scenario of biggest profit has already been discussed above, there may be cases where you look for something else like higher return on pure gems - whether you need to put together the maximum number of gems to buy a box from an event box - or if you need to gather heroic scrolls for summon event (as many are now doing, expecting a summon event at the birthday event). These are the two special cases i will discuss.

&nbsp;

**a) Pure Gems**

If your goal is to gather pure gems, there are only 2 scenarios where you receive rather than spend, **the best of them being scenario 1 (never refresh)**:

&nbsp;



 Scenario  |  Pure gem received  |   Profit 
----------|-------------------|---------
1 |         1113 | 4092
2 |         486 | 5948,4



&nbsp;

**b) Heroic scroll**

**The scenario that gives you the most scrolls is the 14**, with **169 scrolls/month**, 781 gems of daily spending and a profit of 11.1k/month.

If you compare this to the most profitable scenario(12), you are leaving behind 1351 gems. Dividing this by 169 scrolls (which we considered previously as 150 gem each) would increase the price of each scroll to 158 gems. So it would be like **you bought 169 scrolls at 158 gem each.**

&nbsp;

Making the same comparison with the scenarios that give more scrolls than scenario 12, we obtain the following table:

&nbsp;



 Scenario  |  Heroic scroll gain  | Heroic scroll price* | Gem spent daily | Profit
----------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|------
14 | 169 |  158 |  -782,5 |  11160
16 | 160 |  242 | -1484,7 |  -3540
13 | 136 |  150 | -512,8 | 12495
12 | 114 | 150 |  -419 | 12,511

*in comparision to scenario 12 (whose scroll we considered 150 gems)

--
**FINAL WORDS**

&nbsp;

With all that said it is clear that refresh tavern is a very powerful thing that not only gives you the best gem cost-benefit of the whole game as well as has several ways to be used, depending on what you need and how much can you spent.

&nbsp;

There are still other simulations that I did not do (although I believe I have done the ones that matter most) and, more then that, analysis I did not do with the data and points that I did not touch (for example, the rate of appearance of 6star / 7star quests*).

&nbsp;

*its in the spreadsheet. https://1drv.ms/x/s!AkGoX-l9tcfrgi53csVvxnych11c

If you find something wrong or perceived in the data something interesting that can be added, please let me know.

*Gem spent daily is equal to the gem received (just gems, without items) minus the refresh cost, all divided by 30. So basically is the average quantity that you need to pay daily to create the scenario (considering you get 6 quests per day). If positive means you get gems instead of pay.

&nbsp;

Note that it would still be possible to imagine and simulate other scenarios, but I believe that I have taken the most important and relevant ones with regard to what will be analyzed.

&nbsp;

**3. Discussion of results**

As seen in the table above, **the best profit will be given by scenario 12** which requires an expense of 419 gems per day.

But in my opinion **the best cost-benefit is scenario 8**, which gives you a little less gems (12.1k instead of 12.5k) but requires a much lower cost (236 gems per day instead of 419 gems per day)

&nbsp;

It is very important also to note three things:

1. Although the tavern is the best investment of gems in the game you will probably still need to focus your spending on specific items to get the minimum amount to complete events, as well as having some gems in reserve to be able to buy unique offers. So it is important that you follow a scenario consistent with how much you can spend without harming your planning.
1. All table data is based on 6 quests per day during 1 month so if you have access to more or less than that you need to do the proportional calculation (just divide by 6 and multiply by your number of daily quests ).

1.  I did not do the calculation, but the use of quest scrolls will bring different results from the showed because at the moment of use they do not follow the probability distribution considered in the calculations here.

&nbsp;

With that said, the following table shows you **the best scenario for you based on how much you can spend on a daily basis:**

&nbsp;



   Quantity you can spent daily    |    Best scenario  | Profit
----------------------------------|------------------|------
420 or more gems |     12 |  12511,8 
up to 237 gems |      8 |  12110,0
up to 204 gems |      7 |  10965
up to 177 gems |      6 |  10696,5
up to 140 gems |      5 |  10144
up to 92 gems |      4 |  8660,2
up to 40 gems |      3 |  8134,7
nothing* |      2 |  5948,4

*on average.

&nbsp;

**1. Special cases**
  

While the scenario of biggest profit has already been discussed above, there may be cases where you look for something else like higher return on pure gems - whether you need to put together the maximum number of gems to buy a box from an event box - or if you need to gather heroic scrolls for summon event (as many are now doing, expecting a summon event at the birthday event). These are the two special cases i will discuss.

&nbsp;

**a) Pure Gems**

If your goal is to gather pure gems, there are only 2 scenarios where you receive rather than spend, **the best of them being scenario 1 (never refresh)**:

&nbsp;



 Scenario  |  Pure gem received  |   Profit 
----------|-------------------|---------
1 |         1113 | 4092
2 |         486 | 5948,4



&nbsp;

**b) Heroic scroll**

**The scenario that gives you the most scrolls is the 14**, with **169 scrolls/month**, 781 gems of daily spending and a profit of 11.1k/month.

If you compare this to the most profitable scenario(12), you are leaving behind 1351 gems. Dividing this by 169 scrolls (which we considered previously as 150 gem each) would increase the price of each scroll to 158 gems. So it would be like **you bought 169 scrolls at 158 gem each.**

&nbsp;

Making the same comparison with the scenarios that give more scrolls than scenario 12, we obtain the following table:

&nbsp;



 Scenario  |  Heroic scroll gain  | Heroic scroll price* | Gem spent daily | Profit
----------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|------
14 | 169 |  158 |  -782,5 |  11160
16 | 160 |  242 | -1484,7 |  -3540
13 | 136 |  150 | -512,8 | 12495
12 | 114 | 150 |  -419 | 12,511

*in comparision to scenario 12 (whose scroll we considered 150 gems)

--
**FINAL WORDS**

&nbsp;

With all that said it is clear that refresh tavern is a very powerful thing that not only gives you the best gem cost-benefit of the whole game as well as has several ways to be used, depending on what you need and how much can you spent.

&nbsp;

There are still other simulations that I did not do (although I believe I have done the ones that matter most) and, more then that, analysis I did not do with the data and points that I did not touch (for example, the rate of appearance of 6star / 7star quests*).

&nbsp;

*its in the spreadsheet. https://1drv.ms/x/s!AkGoX-l9tcfrgi53csVvxnych11c

&nbsp;

If you find something wrong or perceived in the data something interesting that can be added, please let me know.

",0,"[IN PROGRESS]

&nbsp;

**Important observation:** The calculations were made based on the assumption that within the same quest tier (1 star, 2star, etc ...) the odds are split equally. For example, the chance of getting a 4-star scroll quest would be the same as getting a 4-star gem quest.

&nbsp;

This fact still needs to be proven by studying a large amount of data (which I have already begun to collect). As soon as I have something concrete I will give you feedback. Meanwhile I will move the ""status"" of the post to ""in progress""


Thanks to @Idle_kenny for calling me attention.

**Introduction:**

The objective of this post is to analyze, based on the probability distribution, the result of 17 simulations of different scenarios with regard to the option of refresh in the tavern.

&nbsp;

A **scenario** is a rule you would follow when using the refresh option in the tavern.

* For example: refresh until all quests are 4star or more.

* For example: refresh until all quests are 5star or more, or 4star heroic scroll or 4 star gems.

* For example: refresh until all quests are 6star or more, or 5star heroic scroll, or 5star gems, or 4star heroic scroll, or 4star gems.

* For example: never refresh

* etc, etc ...

&nbsp;

2.  Results table of all simulations

**1. Complete explanation of one simulation case**

The rationale behind the calculations is that by refreshing a quest it tends to follow a distribution that according to wikia would be:

&nbsp;

Tier| Probability| | | |
---|---|----|---- | --- | 
1star | 25%| 3 - 5 gems| 1 basic scroll | 
2star | 27%| 6 - 10 gems| 2 basic scroll| ...
3star| 23%| 15 - 30 gems| ...| ...
4star | 15%| ...| ...| ...
5star | 8%| ...| ...| ...
6star | 1,6%| ...|... | ...
7star | 0,4%| ...|... |...

Source: http://idleheroes.wikia.com/wiki/Tavern

(Acess to view the full table)

&nbsp;

So, considering that within each quest tier  the odds are split equally, if I refresh 1000 quests, 250 will be 1star of which 125 will be gems which means receive 125 * 4 = 500 gems (using the average value (4 gems) of the range (3 to 5 gems)).

&nbsp;

That way, let's analyze what happens in the scenario that we decide to **refresh all the quests until they are 4star or more**. 

&nbsp;

Let's take a sample of 180 quests (1 month worth of quests if you get 6 quests per day (ie vip2 players)). The chance of a quest to be 4star or more is 15% + 8% + 1.6% + 0.4% = 25%. So by the time the 180 quests appear on your screen, 45 (25%) will be 4star or more and 135 (75%) will be 3 star or less. 

&nbsp;

This means that in your **first interaction** you will have 135 quests to refresh.

When you do the refresh, 33.75 (again 25%) will be quests 4star or more and 101.25 (again 75%) will be quests of 3star or less.

This means that in your **second interaction** you will have 101.25 quests to refresh.

&nbsp;

So, the total number of refreshs until all 180 quests are 4star or more is:

135 + 135x0.75 + 135x(0.75)^2 + 135x(0.75)^3 + .......

Do the math and the result will be 540.

&nbsp;

That is, **you will spend 5400 gems to have 180 quests of 4star or more.**

&nbsp;

Now let's look at what you get with these 180 quests, assuming again that they will follow the probability distribution and using the average values of the intervals.

&nbsp;


  Reward of 180 quests at 4star or more  | Quantities
-----------------------------------------|----------
Gem |    2643,8
Heroic Scroll |      44,6
Casino coin |      44,6
Arena ticket |      77,8
Prophet orb |       3,5
Prophet Branch |      144
4star shard |      296,6
5star shard |      18,1
Red artifact shard |      28,8
Green artifact shard |      69,1

&nbsp;

To convert this to gems I will use the following **reference table**:

&nbsp;



Item | Price in gems
----|-------------
Gem | 1
Heroic Scroll | 150
Casino Coin | 30
Arena ticket | 12
Prophet orb | 500
Prophet branch | 5
4star shard | not considered
5star shard | not considered
Red artifact shard | not considered
Green artifact shard  | not considered

&nbsp;

So with 180 quests of 4star or more you will get 14060 gems + 296 4star shard + 18 5star shards + 28 red artifact shard + 69 green artifact shard.

&nbsp;

Your **profit** will then be 14060 - 5400 = **8660 gems + the shards.**

&nbsp;

**2.  Result table of all scenario simulations**

Now following the same reasoning described in 1. (180 quests sample) we can make another 16 scenarios simulations and obtain the following table (ordened from the most to the lesser profitable):


&nbsp;



Scenario |  Profit  |  Gem spent daily* | Heroic Scroll gain

16. keep all 6star+ and 5 star scroll quests |   -3540 | -1485,7  |  160
17. keep all 6star+ quests |  -51012 | -2720,4 |    0

*Gem spent daily is equal to the gem received (just gems, without items) minus the refresh cost, all divided by 30. So basically is the average quantity that you need to pay daily to create the scenario (considering you get 6 quests per day). If positive means you get gems instead of pay.

&nbsp;

Note that it would still be possible to imagine and simulate other scenarios, but I believe that I have taken the most important and relevant ones with regard to what will be analyzed.

"I just got out from my first viewing of Solo, and I thought it was a great movie. I walked in with somewhat low expectations, and I thought the movie would be a lighthearted flick with lots of charm. What I wasn’t expecting was the brutal depiction of war during the beginning moments of the movie. The scene I’m talking about occurs right after Han joins the Imperial Navy; we cut to him in battle with the Empire 3 years later. 

And it’s fucking amazing.

The sky is orange with fire and explosions. Ash-covered stormtroopers mow down oncoming natives and AT-ST’s jump down from cruisers, taking the frontlines. Terrifying war cries like “MY LEG” echo across the constant laser fire and explosions. 

THIS is the Star Wars I always wanted. This type of war and almost hellish reality only existed in the concept art or the Expanded Universe. Not even games like Battlefront could match the sheer intensity of this scene. I was left in awe as the movie cut to the trenches behind the frontlines.

I don’t know if I’m obsessing over this short minute of the movie a little too much, but it was the most memorable part of the film to me. I left the theater satisfied with the movie, but I also left wanting more of that pure chaotic action. Do any of you agree?

"In season 5, Jack didn't merely lose his balance when the last time portal was destroyed; he was unbalanced before then. Long story short, in Eastern Philosophy, Light Is Not Good and Dark Is Not Evil; a person needs to accept that they contain both light and dark in order to be in balance. But Jack has always seen himself as nothing but pure light.
Jack only lost the last time portal because he was too inflexible; rather than realize that he needed to destroy Aku in the future first so that he could then use a portal to return to the past to destroy Aku there without interference, he just kept blindly seeking portals and losing them to Aku. Rigidity of thought and inflexibility is symptomatic of being too unbalanced towards light.
When he killed the sheep, Jack was so horrified at being confronted with his own inner darkness that, ironically, he allowed himself to fall into darkness, because he could not accept that he had any darkness inside of him in the first place.
Thus, Jack's remembrance of his father killing bandits and how he explained that they had brought it upon themselves was important not just so he could face down the Daughters of Aku, but also to begin his healing: Jack did not just find balance by turning back to the light, he found balance by accepting that he does have darkness inside of him and that, sometimes, darkness is necessary.
In other words, season 5 ultimately came to pass because Jack allowed his greatest strength - his purity - to become his greatest weakness!

"And man was it a blast! Had my wife and 4 really good friends at my table, none have played before and only my wife knew anything about how the game was played (we started watching Critical Role together). We had a session 0 last week to get everyone's character sheets done, as a very first time DM I must say session 0s are a MUST.

I gave them each a small soundbite of my world and asked them to write me a backstory and man did they all deliver! They also did their homework so, even though we all have never played before, we were moving along quite well. I never had to stop the game to help them find what they needed, I can't imagine having better players!

They really got into their characters and played off each other wonderfully. My Half-Elf Druid (my wife) was brash and asking some great, blunt questions from my NPCs, searching the woods for animals (she was a Druid of the Moon) and bothering our Gnome (part of her backstory). The Gnome Engineer (Homebrew, he loves tinker types) was playing into his alcoholic and chaotic style, stealing beer and flasks when he could, staying far away from the action and spent about 4 turns during an undead fight trying to crowbar open a door (he has 8 Strength, and was rolling abysmally, even with advantage). My Human Paladin was a wonderful bastion for the group to rally around, leading the charge during their 3 combats over the night and smashing aside all in his path. The first fight, in which a bandit leader punched him after losing an arm wrestle to him, led to the Paladin literally slapping him in the face! He also managed to get some drug like substances from a B&B owner they saved (He is a much more lax Paladin, again Homebrew. I love his character) to which he and the Gnome partook and had some funny interactions with each other. My Teifling Warlock, huge but not very confident, ran into the undead fight screaming like a little girl the entire time until one of the zombies gave him a hearty smack to the back of the head, so he started screaming louder (he was actually screaming, it was really funny). and my last player, a mysterious Human Demon Hunter (Homebrew again, I wanted people to play what they wanted!) was creeping everyone out with his stares and strange demeanour, odd musings and vicious combat style.

It was an incredible night! We started at 6:45 and ended up playing until 2am... We were originally planning to go to midnight, but we were all having so much fun time escaped us!

The major thing I learned is that your players will derp around a lot, we didn't get nearly as far into my campaign as I expected! I am having them be hired to escort a caravan to a town 7 days away and was expecting to end the session with their arrival to said town. But with how much time they spent enjoying the starter city, chatting with one another and my NPCs during the travel and searching the nearby wilderness for animals and plants (along with an undead attack on a B&B and a bandit ambush!) we only made it through 4 days. But the story goes at their pace, and it has already been a great story, so I can't complain at all. They want to play again next Friday! I was originally thinking it would be a monthly thing, but they all really enjoyed it!

No questions from me today but I just wanted to share, D&D truly is a really great way to spend a Friday night with some great friends! I'm so happy that my coworker, who also DMs, never stopped telling me about it.

I wanted to thank everyone who answers questions and shares ideas on this reddit among the others on the sidebar. All of those tips, tricks and ideas made me more prepared to be unprepared and I am really thankful that this community exists!

so a few weeks ago I read somewhere on reddit (maybe this sub?) about an alarm clock app that needs you to scan a barcode to turn it off.

"So, this tale is from last weekend. About 5 minutes after I arrived for my NA shift, and as I was counting the drawer to open my shift, a man approached me.

He asked me if I’m the one that starts at 11 pm. My immediate thought was panic, but I couldn’t remember consciously screwing something up, so I was like, *yes, affirmative. That’s me.*

Turns out the morning shift person told him to come talk to me about making a 6 am link bus to a city in another county. Background context here is that I haven’t owned a car since 2012, so I am extremely familiar with the local, commuter, and link buses in the area. I am also familiar with the uber/Lyft scene in the area, and have ~friends in high places wrt taxis, since my bf owns a taxi service.

Anyway, the morning FD basically told him that I’m the God of Transportation™️ and I could help him and his wife. They were visiting America to see their son graduate from a fairly prestigious college about 30 miles away from my hotel.

I spent about 45 minutes talking with him about his options. I got some estimates from taxi companies, but they were all a little bit more than he wanted to pay because the rates were based on the fact that the drivers would have to drive 10 miles south out of town to the hotel at 05:45 in the morning just to bring him to a bus stop like 2 miles north lol. 

So I talked to him about ride sharing services and told him about how many drivers are typically available that early and how far away they are (which is usually like 15 minutes), and recommend he start early, even though he might have to wait for at least a half hour.

He was very sweet and earnest, and told me that he would wait all day if he needed to, because catching that bus to make it to his son’s graduation was the single most important thing in his life at that moment. 

He didn’t have a phone, so I offered to request the uber for him if he paid me cash, to which he readily agreed and thanked me profusely before going to bed for a few hours.

He and his wife came down around 5:00 am and were very patient as I waited for a driver to accept the ride. And they were just so excited; it was so cute! I did find a driver for them, and spent the 15 minutes we were waiting talking with them about their son. He gave me the fare money (plus some extra 😊) and I told the driver where to take them.

He asked me if I’m the one that starts at 11 pm. My immediate thought was panic, but I couldn’t remember consciously screwing something up, so I was like, *yes, affirmative. That’s me.*

Turns out the morning shift person told him to come talk to me about making a 6 am link bus to a city in another county. Background context here is that I haven’t owned a car since 2012, so I am extremely familiar with the local, commuter, and link buses in the area. I am also familiar with the uber/Lyft scene in the area, and have ~friends in high places wrt taxis, since my bf owns a taxi service.

Anyway, the morning FD basically told him that I’m the God of Transportation™️ and I could help him and his wife. They were visiting America to see their son graduate from a fairly prestigious college about 30 miles away from my hotel.

I spent about 45 minutes talking with him about his options. I got some estimates from taxi companies, but they were all a little bit more than he wanted to pay because the rates were based on the fact that the drivers would have to drive 10 miles south out of town to the hotel at 05:45 in the morning just to bring him to a bus stop like 2 miles north lol. 

So I talked to him about ride sharing services and told him about how many drivers are typically available that early and how far away they are (which is usually like 15 minutes), and recommend he start early, even though he might have to wait for at least a half hour.

He was very sweet and earnest, and told me that he would wait all day if he needed to, because catching that bus to make it to his son’s graduation was the single most important thing in his life at that moment. 

He didn’t have a phone, so I offered to request the uber for him if he paid me cash, to which he readily agreed and thanked me profusely before going to bed for a few hours.

He and his wife came down around 5:00 am and were very patient as I waited for a driver to accept the ride. And they were just so excited; it was so cute! I did find a driver for them, and spent the 15 minutes we were waiting talking with them about their son. He gave me the fare money (plus some extra 😊) and I told the driver where to take them.

"#5 - Tyson vs Holyfield II

Also known as the ""Bite Fight"". In 1996, an Evander Holyfield who was accused of being washed up managed to upset the apple cart, dropping and stopping the WBA champion Tyson. Tyson's camp protested profusely against referee Mitch Halpern being appointed as the referee as they felt Tyson was headbutted without any reprimanding for Holyfield in the first bout, so veteran Mills Lane took over. 

In 1997, the two fighters fought a bad tempered rematch, in which Tyson's eye was split early as the heads repeatedly clashed again and again. Losing and at boiling point, Tyson after another Holyfield headbutt bit down on the ear of Holyfield in a clinch, ripping it off partially and resulting in one of the most shocking boxing moments of all time.

Referee Mills Lane stopped the fight and deducted Tyson two points, whilst allowing the fight to continue. Unhinged and dangerous, Tyson went after Holyfield when the fight continued. As the fighters got close again, Tyson then bit the other ear of Holyfield and taunted him to fight. At the end of the round, Mills Lane threw the fight out. Not finished, Tyson went on the rampage, attacking people in the ring whilst attempting to get at Holyfield.

On the way out of the ring, Tyson was hit by a water bottle in the crowd and had to be restrained as he tried to attack fans and made obscene gestures. Tyson was fined $3,000,000 - a record at the time - and his license was suspended.

#4 - ""Not that one, the one I mixed""

Panama Lewis is known in boxing circles for being a reprehensible sack of shit (more of that later). What first notified the world to this moron was what he was doing in the corner work for Aaron Pryor vs Alexis Arguello.

Before the 14th round, HBO cameras picked up Panama Lewis shouting at the second who was handing him a water bottle ""not that one, the one I mixed"". Aaron Pryor seemed to be regenerated very quickly, before going on to beat Arguello. To this day, only Lewis knows what was in the bottle. Lewis claimed it was water and Perrier, a lot of people watching suspected stimulants. Years later, Luis Resto (another piece of shit) revealed that Lewis would break up asthma capsules and mix them in with water to increase lung capacity.

#3 - Jack Dempsey vs Jess Willard

In 1919, Jack Dempsey fought Jess Willard for the world heavyweight title. Back in the early decades of last century, mob influence and corruption in the sport was rife. In one of the most one sided beatdowns in history, Dempsey dropped Willard 7 times in the first round, fracturing his jaw, cheekbones, breaking his teeth and his ribs. 

After the fight, multiple sources suspected foul play. Dempsey's own manager stated that he had loaded Dempsey's gloves with talcum powder over plaster of paris to be used as an offensive weapon because he had put $10,000 on a Dempsey win and couldn't afford to lose.

Dempsey refused the claims, but there were also several allegations that Dempsey had used a metal plate or a railroad spike, something that very grainy images show hitting the mat.

#2 - Antonio Margarito vs Miguel Cotto I / Shane Mosley

In 2008, ""la Batalla"" was scheduled to take place, between pound for pound fighter Miguel Cotto, and tough Mexican warrior Antonio Margarito. The unbeaten Cotto was widely favoured as the heavier puncher, whilst many expected Margarito to jump Cotto early using his size to take advantage of the smaller Puerto Rican. Over the course of the fight, Margarito swallowed up all of Cotto's offense whilst marching forward, dealing his own power shots.

By the later rounds, Miguel Cotto was beaten up, severely bloodied and fatigued as he couldn't stop the Margarito onslaught with his own shots. He eventually took a knee and Evangelista Cotto threw in the towel for a first devastating career loss. Margarito staked a claim to be the top welterweight in the absence of Floyd Mayweather Jr. 

In 2009, a Shane Mosley having his second wind in the later part of his career signed up to face champion Margarito in a battle for the lineal welterweight crown. Just 30 minutes before the bout was scheduled to take place, controversy erupted as Naazim Richardson alerted NSAC commissioner Dean Lohuis to Javier Capetillo and Antonio Margarito having his hands wrapped with a wet solution present. The Mexican's hands had to then be rewrapped - three times.

After the hands were suitably wrapped, the illegal wraps were taken and held as evidence by the commission. A visibly bothered Margarito made his ringwalk against Mosley, before being battered and beaten down by the American fighter in a TKO loss.

Afterwards, a meeting was held by the NSAC which found that Margarito's handwraps were illegally wrapped and containing plaster of paris, which hardened when wet to result in a plaster cast type wrap. Capetillo had his trainer's license revoked, whilst Margarito had his taken and both heavily fined although Capetillo protested Margarito's innocence. In the fallout of the fight, Miguel Cotto's camp fiercely contested the first fight, showing broken wraps from Margarito with red marks in the same spots as the Mosley seized wraps. 

Margarito has not won a fight by KO, over 9 years since the Mosley fight and the wraps taken.

#1 - Billy Collins Jr vs Luis Resto

In 1983, on the undercard of a Roberto Duran fight, unbeaten prospect Billy Collins Jr suffered a shock loss to unheralded Luis Resto, trained by Panama Lewis. Collins was beaten to a pulp with his face grotesquely damaged. In a show of sportsmanship, Collins' father went to shake the hands of the corner and fighter, and horrifyingly felt that there was no padding inside Resto's gloves.

The NYSAC seized the gloves and determined an inch of padding was taken from each hand. Collins suffered a blurred iris and permanent visual damage, resulting in the immediate end of his career as a fighter. After boxing, Collins never got his life back, descending into a downward spiral of alcoholism. Collins died a few months after the bout, driving his car into a culvert whilst intoxicated - something many believed to be suicide through his inability to fight.

In the investigation, the commission determined Panama Lewis had illegally removed padding from Resto's wraps. For the assault, Resto's license was revoked for a year. 

In 1986, both Resto and Lewis were put on trial for assault, conspiracy and possession of a weapon. Lewis was found guilty and banned from boxing for 15 years. Resto was jailed for assault using a weapon, and served 2 1/2 years.

In 2007, almost 25 years later - Resto apologised to Collins' widow and admitted for the first time that he knew that Lewis tampered with his gloves, before revealing he had done so at least two other times.

He also revealed that Lewis used plaster of paris in his wraps to increase the damage caused by his punches even more. Resto also divulged that Lewis used to crush asthma medication and mix it in water bottles to increase lung capacity. 

Resto was eventually forgiven and allowed to visit Collins' grave site, breaking down and apologising for his part in Collins' demise. The reason behind the loaded gloves were revealed to be to cash in on large bets made on Resto. Panama Lewis gained his license back after 15 years and teaches boxing to children near his apartment. The whole ordeal was made into a documentary; aptly named ""Assault in the ring"".

The Mexican's hands had to then be rewrapped - three times.

After the hands were suitably wrapped, the illegal wraps were taken and held as evidence by the commission. A visibly bothered Margarito made his ringwalk against Mosley, before being battered and beaten down by the American fighter in a TKO loss.

Afterwards, a meeting was held by the NSAC which found that Margarito's handwraps were illegally wrapped and containing plaster of paris, which hardened when wet to result in a plaster cast type wrap. Capetillo had his trainer's license revoked, whilst Margarito had his taken and both heavily fined although Capetillo protested Margarito's innocence. In the fallout of the fight, Miguel Cotto's camp fiercely contested the first fight, showing broken wraps from Margarito with red marks in the same spots as the Mosley seized wraps. 

Margarito has not won a fight by KO, over 9 years since the Mosley fight and the wraps taken.

#1 - Billy Collins Jr vs Luis Resto

In 1983, on the undercard of a Roberto Duran fight, unbeaten prospect Billy Collins Jr suffered a shock loss to unheralded Luis Resto, trained by Panama Lewis. Collins was beaten to a pulp with his face grotesquely damaged. In a show of sportsmanship, Collins' father went to shake the hands of the corner and fighter, and horrifyingly felt that there was no padding inside Resto's gloves.

The NYSAC seized the gloves and determined an inch of padding was taken from each hand. Collins suffered a blurred iris and permanent visual damage, resulting in the immediate end of his career as a fighter. After boxing, Collins never got his life back, descending into a downward spiral of alcoholism. Collins died a few months after the bout, driving his car into a culvert whilst intoxicated - something many believed to be suicide through his inability to fight.

In the investigation, the commission determined Panama Lewis had illegally removed padding from Resto's wraps. For the assault, Resto's license was revoked for a year. 

In 1986, both Resto and Lewis were put on trial for assault, conspiracy and possession of a weapon. Lewis was found guilty and banned from boxing for 15 years. Resto was jailed for assault using a weapon, and served 2 1/2 years.

In 2007, almost 25 years later - Resto apologised to Collins' widow and admitted for the first time that he knew that Lewis tampered with his gloves, before revealing he had done so at least two other times.

He also revealed that Lewis used plaster of paris in his wraps to increase the damage caused by his punches even more. Resto also divulged that Lewis used to crush asthma medication and mix it in water bottles to increase lung capacity. 

Resto was eventually forgiven and allowed to visit Collins' grave site, breaking down and apologising for his part in Collins' demise. The reason behind the loaded gloves were revealed to be to cash in on large bets made on Resto. Panama Lewis gained his license back after 15 years and teaches boxing to children near his apartment. The whole ordeal was made into a documentary; aptly named ""Assault in the ring"".

"***Good day folks***,

I finally had some time. I got Strider (Lutris creator) to build Wine-Staging 3.9 with PBA + Firerat's ""knobs_and_switches"" patches. I decided to fork all my older installers, revamp them, add what I needed to add, remove what I felt I had to remove. Then I added Bling, like setting ENV variables that will show DXVK HUD when you enable DXVK for the DX11 games that support it. Then I decided to throw my hair loose and also make an Overwatch installer, since I can't let Djazz have all the fun.

So, here we go!!!! Updated installers for Lutris for the all the Blizzard Games:

* [**Blizzard App:**](https://lutris.net/games/battlenet/) Just a standalone version for updating games if you need/want it.

"I am in a mostly recovered dead bedroom. About four years ago we reached a point where we had sex twelve times in twelve months and I confronted her about it. We started marital counseling and saw significant improvement. These days we average sex once a week. Sometimes there are bigger gaps and sometimes smaller. 

I still crave sex more often, and I work hard not to smother my wife. She has anxiety regarding sex, so if I come on too strong she feels the opposite of aroused. As a result she is responsible for initiating much of the time. I may make suggestions, but I have to try hard to make them non-threatening and low stakes. She's pretty good about knowing when I am strongly craving sex and doing something about it.

I had my birthday recently. My wife knew she was going to be on her period, so she deliberately arranged for sex right at the onset of her period. While I was ready to suggest a birthday blow-job, she really doesn't enjoy giving oral sex and she doesn't like sexual contact while on her period.

So on my birthday I arranged to do fun things that didn't involve her. I was out hiking most of the day and playing board games in the evening. The family went out for Mexican food and margaritas at dinner time, but mostly I spent the day having fun away from my wife. 

Last night my wife wakes me up at 1:30 am to tell me there is a bat in our bedroom. She turns on a light, and sure enough there is a bat flying around the room. So I grudgingly go get the net (used for cleaning a pond we don't have anymore) from the garage and then catch the bat and release it outdoors. By the time it's all done, I'm not close to asleep anymore. As we turn out the lights and settle back in, I suggest that now might be a good time for that birthday blow-job. She says nothing and we both go to sleep (though I definitely toss and turn a bit).

This morning we are cuddling, but we don't want to start anything because we anticipate out 10 year old daughter will be climbing into our bed (on this Saturday morning). I get out of bed and my wife gives me a hug and says that she is thinking about making time for me and that maybe we can have sex this afternoon. 

So this is the big thing. **I believed her.** Five years ago I would not have trusted her to follow through on a promise like that. But after the work and counseling we have been through, I trusted her to make it a priority, because our marriage and our relationship is a priority. Sure enough, this afternoon she asked me to meet her in the bedroom in half an hour (allowing her time to get herself in a proper frame of mind). I was fashionably late and we had active engaged sex.

We still struggle with mismatched libidos. I have to decide if I can accept what she can give. I have to move beyond the years of broken promises and disregard for my feelings. But we have a shared goal of making our marriage work. While I don't trust her to always prioritize our sex life, I do trust her to take it seriously and understand how important it is to me.

But if you don't trust your spouse to take your needs and feelings seriously, you need to take steps to either fix your marriage or end your marriage.",4,1528020427.0,8o5g57,False,"I am in a mostly recovered dead bedroom.

"As a  makeup artist for weddings, I have lots of contacts/acquaintances/friends in the biz and would like nothing more than to offer them my business for my wedding. All have been great, professional and have offered me good rates except one.... I contacted a hairstylist I have worked MANY weddings with and used to be friends with to do my hair for my wedding. Firstly, she required a 3-person minimum (not the end of the world, I guess my bridesmaids can use her services too) but things just went downhill from there. She would take days to respond to my messages, and kept upping her demands (price, timing, etc). Finally, she requested a deposit (which wouldn’t be weird if she wasn’t a personal contact who I know quite well). I said “sure” and she asked I pay by November (no problem!). BUT I asked her to remind me, as I’m planning my wedding, working two jobs, moving and caring for a sick parent, and she refused by saying “actually I’ll need you to remind ME about your booking” because apparently she doesn’t book for 2019 until November (why did she not tell me this at first?

Abstract
Objective To examine the associations between the regular consumption of spicy foods and total and cause specific mortality.

Design Population based prospective cohort study.

Setting China Kadoorie Biobank in which participants from 10 geographically diverse areas across China were enrolled between 2004 and 2008.

Participants 199 293 men and 288 082 women aged 30 to 79 years at baseline after excluding participants with cancer, heart disease, and stroke at baseline.

Main exposure measures Consumption frequency of spicy foods, self reported once at baseline.

Main outcome measures Total and cause specific mortality.

Results During 3 500 004 person years of follow-up between 2004 and 2013 (median 7.2 years), a total of 11 820 men and 8404 women died. Absolute mortality rates according to spicy food consumption categories were 6.1, 4.4, 4.3, and 5.8 deaths per 1000 person years for participants who ate spicy foods less than once a week, 1 or 2, 3 to 5, and 6 or 7 days a week, respectively. **Spicy food consumption showed highly consistent inverse associations with total mortality among both men and women after adjustment for other known or potential risk factors.** In the whole cohort, compared with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week, the adjusted hazard ratios for death were 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.96), 0.86 (0.80 to 0.92), and 0.86 (0.82 to 0.90) for those who ate spicy food 1 or 2, 3 to 5, and 6 or 7 days a week, respectively. **Compared with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week, those who consumed spicy foods 6 or 7 days a week showed a 14% relative risk reduction in total mortality.** The inverse association between spicy food consumption and total mortality was stronger in those who did not consume alcohol than those who did (P=0.033 for interaction). Inverse associations were also observed for deaths due to cancer, ischemic heart diseases, and respiratory diseases.

"I worked in a travel company for far too many years because I genuinely loved my job and my repeat clients but not so much the pay and crazy hours. We had a set up where if someone made a complaint about you in any way no matter how unreasonable, (I have had complaints about the fact the hotel rooms were GREEN. Clients wife had a phobia about the colour GREEN it was my fault for booking them into the hotel they requested and not being psychic and knowing the wife is scared of GREEN) it was sent to head office first, who then forwarded it to the area manager after tearing strips off them for the horrible service/fuck up, then the direct manager who made you take “responsibility” for the complaint and rectifying it and in many cases, wear the cost of fixing it, even if it’s thousands of dollars. It’s important to note that complaints could affect bonuses and result in termination so the higher ups took this shit SERIOUSLY. 

Anyway, I rarely had complaints but one day I am copied into this furious ranting email from the area manager and head office and DM about the repercussions I will personally face about this horrible thing I did to a client ruining EVERYTHING for them. I had to step up immediately and FIX this error and call the client back with my proposed resolution while my direct manager and area manager etc were listening and report the resolution of my serious infraction to head office or else! There were a couple of heated phone calls demanding I explain myself and drop everything to fix it. Shit.

I’m conflicted averse and can get a little anxious so I’m a bit shaky before I even read the full email details of the complaint because I’ve already been reamed about it and have nfi what I could’ve done as I’m pedantic AF. 

I take a break and start reading the details of what I’ve supposedly done. It’s major. 

The client is stranded overseas with invalid hotel vouchers in random European expensive  country in summer peak
Time because the supplier was not only never paid but they were given a weird statement instead of the vouchers the hotel required (only a printout of the details) so they turned up to fancy OS place without a room on their honeymoon for a week and then discovered their flights were booked to a wrong city even though invoice/original etickets showed the correct one also and agent didn’t return their phone calls or emails and it had been days and they were distraught. Major fuckup.

Except it wasn’t my fuckup. My name or ID and store is in no way affiliated with this person. I don’t have their customer file and they booked with someone in a different state under a different area. My only connection to this person is that they called a generic number for X company in hysterics from Overseas in desperation and it was randomly routed to me.

I heard about their horror trip, calmed them down, commiserated, stepped them through the complaint process they should really really do was and transferred them at company cost to the emergency after hours section in head office with a warm transfer explaining the situation to the person who answered and who can do emergency repairs after hours to other areas bookings which I could not. 

My manager was furious at the cockup because the only time my name was Mentioned was in glowing praise for how I had helped them sort everything out and that my advice etc had helped them sort it all but we had both had to reschedule some pretty big booking appointments to deal with this but nobody would listen to us and insisted we make the call regardless. My manager said

“Fuck it, don’t call the mobile they took from here or the hotel, call the disposable local mobile they bought which costs a bomb to call
Instead!”

So I called them as demanded while everyone listened and they were SO excited it was me ringing!  They were so glad I called them because they didn’t know how to reach me to thank me personally even though they wrote in the complaint how awesome I was and had helped them solve their horrible holiday cockup! I spent 25 minutes on that phone call with superiors listening, chatting about their now fixed honeymoon and their plans to see things and suggested some nice free sites they could head to. To cut down on expenditure since they were starting out married
Life together. They were so happy!

My manager is furious about our potential lost business and that I had been shat on  and demanded successfully that head office pay for the international phone call. They never apologised for anything but did quietly credit us the amount for the phone call. 

TL;Dr I did my job and saved my company a potential court case but nobody looked at the complaint as per protocol so had to sit through an expensive phone call listening to my not client who wasn’t even complaining about me, praise me for being awesome and had to pay for  it.






ETA sorry for formatting and stuff, I am on mobile. Gah.

ETA ETA

Suggested edit from comments.  

The call cost about $60.

Because of the structure of the business and no one wanting it to be their expense or coming out of their operating costs, there was also a fair bit of time wasting involved to get them to pay it. Even with approval it still had to go through each areas accountant and manager before being pushed up the path until ahead Office finally paid for it.

I also didn’t need to be on the phone so long. My manager was MC initially and I could’ve achieved what I needed without stretching the call as long as I did. I also told the clients a lot of stuff they could do for free instead of booking and paying for a similar thing through us.

I don’t have their customer file and they booked with someone in a different state under a different area. My only connection to this person is that they called a generic number for X company in hysterics from Overseas in desperation and it was randomly routed to me.

I heard about their horror trip, calmed them down, commiserated, stepped them through the complaint process they should really really do was and transferred them at company cost to the emergency after hours section in head office with a warm transfer explaining the situation to the person who answered and who can do emergency repairs after hours to other areas bookings which I could not. 

My manager was furious at the cockup because the only time my name was Mentioned was in glowing praise for how I had helped them sort everything out and that my advice etc had helped them sort it all but we had both had to reschedule some pretty big booking appointments to deal with this but nobody would listen to us and insisted we make the call regardless. My manager said

“Fuck it, don’t call the mobile they took from here or the hotel, call the disposable local mobile they bought which costs a bomb to call
Instead!”

So I called them as demanded while everyone listened and they were SO excited it was me ringing!  They were so glad I called them because they didn’t know how to reach me to thank me personally even though they wrote in the complaint how awesome I was and had helped them solve their horrible holiday cockup! I spent 25 minutes on that phone call with superiors listening, chatting about their now fixed honeymoon and their plans to see things and suggested some nice free sites they could head to. To cut down on expenditure since they were starting out married
Life together. They were so happy!

My manager is furious about our potential lost business and that I had been shat on  and demanded successfully that head office pay for the international phone call. They never apologised for anything but did quietly credit us the amount for the phone call. 

TL;Dr I did my job and saved my company a potential court case but nobody looked at the complaint as per protocol so had to sit through an expensive phone call listening to my not client who wasn’t even complaining about me, praise me for being awesome and had to pay for  it.

The call cost about $60.

Because of the structure of the business and no one wanting it to be their expense or coming out of their operating costs, there was also a fair bit of time wasting involved to get them to pay it. Even with approval it still had to go through each areas accountant and manager before being pushed up the path until ahead Office finally paid for it.

I also didn’t need to be on the phone so long. My manager was MC initially and I could’ve achieved what I needed without stretching the call as long as I did. I also told the clients a lot of stuff they could do for free instead of booking and paying for a similar thing through us. ",0,"I worked in a travel company for far too many years because I genuinely loved my job and my repeat clients but not so much the pay and crazy hours. We had a set up where if someone made a complaint about you in any way no matter how unreasonable, (I have had complaints about the fact the hotel rooms were GREEN. Clients wife had a phobia about the colour GREEN it was my fault for booking them into the hotel they requested and not being psychic and knowing the wife is scared of GREEN) it was sent to head office first, who then forwarded it to the area manager after tearing strips off them for the horrible service/fuck up, then the direct manager who made you take “responsibility” for the complaint and rectifying it and in many cases, wear the cost of fixing it, even if it’s thousands of dollars. It’s important to note that complaints could affect bonuses and result in termination so the higher ups took this shit SERIOUSLY. 

Anyway, I rarely had complaints but one day I am copied into this furious ranting email from the area manager and head office and DM about the repercussions I will personally face about this horrible thing I did to a client ruining EVERYTHING for them. I had to step up immediately and FIX this error and call the client back with my proposed resolution while my direct manager and area manager etc were listening and report the resolution of my serious infraction to head office or else! There were a couple of heated phone calls demanding I explain myself and drop everything to fix it. Shit.

I’m conflicted averse and can get a little anxious so I’m a bit shaky before I even read the full email details of the complaint because I’ve already been reamed about it and have nfi what I could’ve done as I’m pedantic AF. 

I take a break and start reading the details of what I’ve supposedly done. It’s major. 

The client is stranded overseas with invalid hotel vouchers in random European expensive  country in summer peak
Time because the supplier was not only never paid but they were given a weird statement instead of the vouchers the hotel required (only a printout of the details) so they turned up to fancy OS place without a room on their honeymoon for a week and then discovered their flights were booked to a wrong city even though invoice/original etickets showed the correct one also and agent didn’t return their phone calls or emails and it had been days and they were distraught. Major fuckup.

"Today I went out to eat after a show. (I'm a teacher and we just had our big end of year performance with the little kids) I poured out a big pile of ketchup onto a plate for everyone to dip their fries.

My second mistake was to drop my phone into the pile of ketchup. It did make a nice glerping noise when it landed, though!
Dropping a phone in ketchup would have been enough for a TIFU. 

So I pondered the error of my ways as I wiped off the phone.  That was where I made my third mistake. I didn't notice I didn't get all the ketchup off.  

My 4th mistake was putting the phone away.   Here I should mention that because women's clothing never has pockets, ""away"" means I typically slip my phone into my bra. The phone was fully stowed before my brain registered the icky feeling. It was chilly and squelchy and wet. If only the story ended there! 

The third time is supposed to be the charm, but I had one more mistake left to make - I tried to fix it. 
My 5th mistake was to clean up ketchup from inside my bra at a table with kids. I realized that I had my hands down the front of my bra in front of students.

"I was listening to some Bach yesterday, when this question came to my mind. Big orchestral pieces involve several different instruments. Piano, violin, cello, bass, woodwinds, brasses, and most composers were piano players. I know that on that level, knowing multiple instruments is not a big deal, but they couldn’t know all of them... or could they? 
So my real question is that how did they think and write? Did they play the music on the piano, and from that, and some music theory, figured out, that they should write this part as the part of the clarinet player? Or did they rely only on music theory to find out what the clarinet player should play? Or did they play the clarinet part themselves, and write it down from there?

I tried to discuss this with some of my friends, but they didn’t know.

So my real question is that how did they think and write? Did they play the music on the piano, and from that, and some music theory, figured out, that they should write this part as the part of the clarinet player? Or did they rely only on music theory to find out what the clarinet player should play? Or did they play the clarinet part themselves, and write it down from there?

[Google Won’t Seek to Renew Pentagon Contract After Internal Backlash](http://archive.is/I2WjY#selection-2307.0-2307.68) (Short WSJ article)

[How a Pentagon Contract Became an Identity Crisis for Google](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/technology/google-project-maven-pentagon.html) (Long NYT article)

I think this is beyond the usual cigarette/gun/prison stocks. I had read an article in Barron's awhile ago arguing that pension funds, etc. who are divesting from gun stocks as a response to shootings are wrong because their primary responsibility is to fund pensions/etc., not take a moral stand for a certain percentage of their investors, at a loss of potential gains.

I'm reading that the letter was signed by about 4000 employees, which would be 4.7% of their employees. Should 4.7% of a company's employees, who may or may not be varying degrees of shareholders, impact potential lucrative business decisions? From the WSJ article:

> Just as some employees have protested Google’s work with the government, others expressed concern that the opinions of low-level employees shouldn’t have a bearing on the company’s business contracts.

Do you think the support or opposition to (potentially lethal) government contracts would impact recruiting/retention? Obviously the west coast is a lot different than the east coast, where defense contractors make a more positive impact on the local economy.

"First time posting but I have to express my gratitude to this sub for a few reasons. 

I became obsessed with watching a couple of presenters putting on make up. The 2 I watched mesmerized me with their skills and their makeup actually looked pretty to me.  One in particular had killer eyeshadow skills and drew a perfect wing every time. Her lashes didn’t look like spider legs. She wasn’t crazy with brows either.  (Although lately they have started looking horrible, like 2 oversized arches above her eyes).  The other presenter I watched had a bubbly personality and was pretty good with her skills as well but I mostly watched her and rolled my eyes at her obvious narcissistic comments. 

I practiced their techniques with my drug store brands and wasn’t getting the results so I assumed it was the makeup I was using.  So I bought the kit and added on the foundation pack.  I was so excited to try out my products only to be extremely disappointed. I bought the kit with the intention of testing out the product quality and if I wasn’t happy I wouldn’t even attempt to sell or promote it.  Thankful I stuck to that vow. 

I feel I have a good understanding of applying makeup so it doesn’t look horrible. I usually go with modest neutral looks but sometimes go for the Smokey eye look.  Im very conscious of foundation matching and BLENDING.  Reading some comments about their products not blending helped me realize it’s not my lack of skills or proper tools but the low quality product I wasted my money on. 

The foundation was the biggest disappointment and I blamed my skin for this. Thank goodness I came across this sub proving I’m not the only one who thinks their products are garbage.

"Hey guys, 
I've been playing hearthstone since just before Whispers of the Old Gods came out, and I just reached legend for the first time last month with a **62% winrate Control Paladin** deck! So I'm posting this guide to brag on Reddit, but also to discuss my thoughts and experiences about the post-nerf Witchwood metagame and the current state of Control Paladin. 

Here are my [Stats](https://imgur.com/a/993k6cQ) from rank 4 to legend.
Here is my [proof](https://imgur.com/a/0muV5le)  of legend.


**Why Control Paladin?**
So why Control Paladin?  I've been trying make Control Paladin work since Un'goro (with decent success actually, since I got to rank 5 for the first time with Control Pally) because although a lot of other classes were better for a control strategy, I just loved how powerful Paladin's equality + consecrate/pyro combos were to clear the board. Although it's essentially a two card twisting nether and doesn't even work against divine shield minions, unlike twisting nether, it is available from turn 3-4 onwards to stop early/midgame boards, and is only 4-6 mana so you can develop your own board after clearing theirs. Even aggro decks like Even Pally used this combo to gain board control. In the end, this is THE single biggest reason to play Control Pally imo. 

Control Paladin is also one of the few decks that can be dual natured. Against fast decks, you have the ability to play as the control deck, but against even slower decks like quest priest, you have the ability to play against the aggressive deck. This is because some of the deck’s best control tools, like Truesilver Champion, Sunkeeper Tarim, Blessing of Kings and Uther of the Ebon Blade are also *really* good at hitting face. Because of this, the deck is very adaptable to whatever you’re facing. Keep in mind that the deck’s aggressive strategy aims to win around turns 8-12, so against fast combo decks like Quest Rogue or Cubelock, it is still heavily unfavored.

There is one more reason why playing Control Paladin can be a good idea, and it is that people are not expecting it...The reason I had a +50% winrate with Control Pally from Un'goro to Pre-nerf Witchwood metas, which were ravaged by Quest Rogue, Jade Druid, Razakus Priest and Cubelock was that everyone who queued up against me mulliganed thinking I was gonna try to kill them by turn 5. I was able to play off of what every other Paladin deck in the meta was and use the surprise factor to my advantage. Even if Control Paladin becomes popular in this metagame, which I doubt, people queuing up against paladin need to decide whether it's Odd/murloc Paladin, or Control Paladin, and that can be very advantageous. 

**Why Now?**
The few advantages I listed about playing Control Paladin have been around for a while, so obviously they're not the reason why I my winrate suddenly jumped up from 52% to 62%. Nor do I think that it was just because I got a few lucky games. I played about 70 games from rank 5 to 2300 legend, which I recorded on my computer starting at rank 4, and I felt a significant improvement in the performance of this deck than in previous metas. For a long time, Control Pally struggled in the meta. I could win off of aggro decks a decent portion of the time, but my deck was inconsistent, the health regen was limited, I ran out of cards quickly, and the late game was terrible. However, after getting to the final version of my list, I got to legend from rank 4 to 2300 legend with a 62% winrate, the highest winrate of any deck I ever played, and I think there are a few reasons for that:
    * Cubelock and Quest rogue, both very strong against Control Pally, got nerfed.
    * With the exception of miragle rogue, there are not that many burst-heavy combo decks on ladder anymore. Maybe Quest rogue returns in the future, but even then it's burst potential got nerfed.
    * The Witchwood gave Control Paladin some really good tools that it needed to cover up it's weaknesses. Notably Vicious Scalehide and Sound the Bells!.
    * The post-nerf meta is much slower, giving Control Paladin enough time to build to its late game win condition.
    * Control Paladin actually has a late game win condition now, or it did since Kobolds and Katacombs (It's Lynessa).

I hope that I conveyed why Control Paladin did not do so well in previously (Cubelock and Quest Rogue), and why I think it can the potential do really well now (No Cubelock and Quest Rogue). There, that was a pretty simple TL;DR. 
Now let's get into the deck itself:

So first off, please keep in mind that I am, by no means, an expert deck builder. This final list I came up with isn’t perfect, and looking back, there are still things I would change. I’m not exactly sure what’s core and what can be cut, If you have a different opinion, please feel free to comment! Also, I know the name of this deck sucks. I didn’t want to generically call it Control Paladin, but Buff Paladin isn’t that good either. I’m working on the name and am open to suggestions! 

Also, I made this guide very long to explain as much as possible since a lot of people don’t play Control Paladin. Feel free to skip around and just see what cards/matchups you’re interested in. 

**Core Cards**

* Equality - As I stated earlier, I think this card is THE reason to play Control Paladin, and I am certain that the deck would not exist without this card. Simply put, having this card in your hand is going to win games, and you will lose others because you did not draw this card. You also need a Wild Pyro or Consecrate you combo with this most of the time, so be careful not to use them up and have nothing to combo with your equalities. 

* Vicious Scalehide -  I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/8cdgap/vicious_scalehide_is_the_sleeper_of_the_set/) on r/hearthstone near the very beginning of the Witchwood meta talking about how good Vicious Scalehide was in Control Paladin, and I still stand by the points that I made. This is the best buff target in the deck. The card’s lifesteal + rush ability mean that your buffs gain rush/lifesteal as well, and can trade with your opponent’s minions to gain board control and health. It is one of the few cards with lifesteal in the deck, so use it carefully. 

* Sound the Bells! - It can be used paired with Scalehide for the typical buff + lifesteal, in the early/late game, although Kings is usually better with Scalehide in the mid-game. This card is also AMAZING with Wild Pyromancer, because you get to buff you pyromancer, while also basically playing a warpath. This combo is great at dealing with medium sized boards with 3-5 health when you don’t want to use up an equality. It is also a good tool to get value trades with, or buff important minions out of some AOE range. Finally, against late game decks, you want to use this card as much as possible, because it will turn your Lynessa into a 23/41 beast. Overall, it is just very versatile and compliments the deck’s internal synergies very well. 

* Wild Pyromancer - This is a staple card in Control Paladin because of its combo potential with equality, with consecration for a 3 damage AOE, and even with Sound the Bells. This also combos well with Acolyte of pain, since any spell cast will draw you cards. Keeping this card in your hand is very important if you want to clear the board, so use it conservatively. Be careful though, because it also deals damage to your own board!  Proper use of this card is one of the most important things to learn to properly pilot a Control Paladin imo.

* Acolyte of Pain - I’m not entirely sure if this card is core or not, but I’m leaning towards at least one being core for now. Control Paladin relies on a lot of combos like pyro+equality to be able to clear the board and buff your minions to gain life, and Acolyte is a great card draw tool to consistently get these combos off. 

* Stonehill Defender - This card is a decent early game taunt, one of the few early game minions you want to play on curve, but can also generate late game threats to close out games. It generates cards like Tirion or Lich king that can bait out removal for your other Lich king, or more importantly, Lynessa. Don’t be afraid to pick those righteous protectors against aggro tho. 

* Zola the Gorgon - This cards exists primarily to combo with Lynessa since you can play them both in one turn. After exhausting their removal, there shouldn’t a single card in your opponent's deck that can stand up to a 19/41 Lynessa… and even if there is, you have another one! Sometimes, if you feel like your opponent may be able to remove both Lynessas, against a big spell mage for instance, it’s better to Get an extra copy of Elise instead.

* Blessing of Kings - This is a very important mid game card as it is the best card to combo with your Acolyte of pain, Stonehill defender, or especially vicious scalehide. Being able to trade with a 5/7 Acolyte of pain on 4 is a great way to control the board and draw cards, against a leokk or misha for example, and with Scalehide, you get a 5/7 rush/lifesteal, another very powerful way to restore health. 

* Consecration - This is a good early/mid game AOE tool, and combos well with equality and Wild Pyromancer. The benefit of using Consecration with equality over pyromancer is that although equality+pyromancer only costs 4 mana, equality + consecrate does not clear your board, so you can still attack with your minions after clearing their board, something really useful against taunt druid, for instance. It is this deck’s best early game response to token decks  since you often want to save Wild Pyro to combo with Sound the Bells. As with Wild pyro, be careful not to use it too quickly, because you might need it to proc your equality later. 

* Truesilver Champion - This is your best friend against Rogues and Spiteful Druids. It kills Auctioneers, it kills Hench Clan Thugs, it kills Vicious Fledglings, it kills the Fal’dorei Strider, it now kills the minions buffed by the rogue quest, and any other early game minion that most aggro decks use except Tar Creeper. 

* Spikeridged Steed - This is the most important buff in the deck because this is what gives Lynessa taunt. It is also an amazing tool against aggro decks and spiteful druid, although you should expect this to get silenced. Therefore, you should use steed on a minion you can value trade with immediately so that even if it does get silenced, you are not in a bad position. 

* Sunkeeper Tarim - If you’ve played against any aggressive paladin deck in the past year, you know how strong this card is. It turns out be a very good control tool as well, because you can buff up your dudes, your scalehides, etc, and make the best value trades ever. If you have a truesilver equipped, taking lets you kill any minion. Or, you can just buff everything and go face. This is one of the best dual-natured cards in the history of hearthstone. 

* Lynessa Sunsorrow - This card is THE late game win condition of this deck, allowing you to double dip on buff spells to generate up to a 23/41 taunt with deathrattle: summon 2 stegodons. This also the prime removal target in the deck, combing this will Zola gives extra insurance. Always try to get your opponent to expend as much silence/removal as possible before playing Lynessa though. 

* Uther of the Ebon Blade - He represents 15 damage, 20 healing, and free 2/2 minions for the rest of the game that demand removal. Control Paladin has a lot of taunt minions, so you can keep summoning horsemen behind the taunts, threatening to win with the apocalypse, demanding some immediate removal.

** Non-Core Inclusions**

* Firefly - I’m not sure if Firefly is a good fit for the deck, and am considering replacing this with either a doomsayer, or another late game bomb like Tirion. I originally added it because the 1 mana tokens are better buff targets than the 2 mana dudes, and the token are good with Tarim.

* Witchwood Piper - Acolyte of Pain isn’t enough for card draw, especially not for a deck so combo dependent, so since some of the best combo cards in the deck are some of the deck’s cheapest minions, I added Witchwood Piper to consistently draw either Wild Pyro or Vicious Scalehide.

* Elise the Trailblazer - I’m honestly just thinking of adding her to the core list, but I’m not, since you can still technically play Control Paladin without her. She is one of the best value tools in the deck, and a great way to deal with decks like Big Spell mage, Quest Priest, and sometimes even Spell Hunter since they can gain value with their zombeasts. Also, she’s the only 5 mana card in the deck, so dropping her on 5 can add decent board control or board pressure. If the board isn’t important, I’d save playing her until you have Zola. 

*Skulking Geist - This is one of the best tech cards in the game right now. Playing this against taunt druid to get rid of their naturalize, against deathrattle hunter to delete play dead, against spell hunter to delete hunter’s mark and tracking, against control/cubelock to delete dark pact, and against rouge to delete coldblood and deadly poison can be game winning in a lot of situations. It’s got a decent body as well.

* The Lich King - He’s a great late game minion that provides pressure and value while also baiting removal. A good lich King card like Death Grip or Frostmourne can be game winning.

**Other Cards to Consider**

* Corpsetaker - This is a solid drop on turn 4, since it will usually have taunt, divine shield and lifesteal. It’s a great card to buff and very solid against aggro decks. If you want to add corpsetakers, you should add most of the divine shield Minions I mention below, and maybe another lifesteal minion. 

* Righteous Protector - Instead of Firefly, Righteous protector can be includes as a one drop since the divine shield works well with buffs. I opted for firefly instead because providing 2 bodies is better for buffs and tarim.

* The Glass Knight - I ran this card at first just as a 4 mana 4/3 divine shield, and it ended up not being that good. Token decks can easily remove the divine shield and kill it, druid can pop the shield with it’s hero power, and mage has cards like arcane missiles to deal with it. The Glass knight is a great buff target, since that reduces the chances of it dying, and getting multiple divine shield from things like true silver gives you so many value trades. But that usually means having to wait until turns 8-10 to play it with kings or steed, and I feel like there are better things you can do.

* Bolvar, fireblood - Take this one with a grain of salt. I don’t own Bolvar, and have never played with him. From a theorycrafting perspective, he seems like a really good inclusion in the deck if you want to add corpse takers and other divine shield minions. He can gain attack quickly and be something people have to waste removal on. He also transitions well into a turn 6 steed. Try him out if you have him!

* Tirion Fordring - A great late game card that adds a lot of extra pressure to the deck. Be warned though that the Ashbringer often contests with Frostmourne and the Uther of the Ebon Blade, making playing these cards feel very awkward and reducing their full value. 

* Captain Greenskin - No Seriously, this card is pretty good in Control Paladin, and I ran him for a long time during KoFT when Bonemare was a thing. He’s another 5 drop in a deck that seriously lacks them, and is a great play after a turn 4 truesilver. His true value comes after playing Uther, because you get a 6/4 lifesteal weapon, meaning 24 damage and 24 healing. If you run Tirion, you will have a weapon to buff most of the time. 

* Aldor Peacekeeper - This has always been a good minion for control Paladin, but there are not that many minions to hit with this in the meta right now. Aldor should be a tech option against warlocks’ mountain giants and druids’ spiteful summoners, although Tarim does the job as well.

* Paragon of Light - This minion gains taunt and lifesteal when buffed, making it a prime blessing of kings target by you, and a silence target by your opponent. I used to run it, but took it out because I thought draw from Acolyte was better. This is still a good tech option against miracle rogues and aggro decks to give you more lifesteal and board pressure. 

* Baleful Banker - Specifically a tech against Quest Priest and Big Spell Mage, so that you can get another big threat, maybe even 3 Lynessas, and you don’t go into fatigue as quickly.

* Doomsayer - Doomsayer can be a good tech option against tempo mage since it can clear the early mana wyrm and can counter explosive runes.It is also decent against most aggro decks, but actively weakens the control matchup, and this deck already has a good matchup vs aggro.

*Blackwald Sprite - For those of you who want to cheese games with Uther’s hero power. If you have 2 horsemen on board, you can instantly summon 2 more and cheese out a win from your unsuspecting opponent. It’s a good tech against control and the 3/4 body is good against aggro.

**Game Plan, Matchups & Mulligans**

Since this game plan of this deck relies on what kind of deck you facing, I’ll try to go over both at the same time:

* Druid - Since there are so many druid archetypes, it’s hard to know exactly what you’re up against, but I typically mulligan for skulking geist for taunt druid, an acolyte for draw, and a wild pyro in case it is spiteful or token druid. 
    * Combo/Malygos Druid - I only faced one combo druid on ladder, so while I don’t have much experience with the matchup, I would say that Control Paladin is favored. Druid naturally just sucks against big minions, and Control Paladin plays a bunch of big minions. Don’t hero power to play against spreading plague, and just hit face with your weapons, as there are very few things you need to trade with. You also have healing, so you can usually stay around 30 health. Ideally, the druid expends all their spells trying to kill your minions. 
    * Spiteful - I think I won against every Spiteful Druid I faced on ladder. I usually use an early equality to clear their board around turns 5-6, and I have Tarim and another equality to deal with any big spiteful minions. Control Paladin has enough healing to stay out of range of Leeroy, and has enough board control tools to win the game. Be wary of silence whenever you play Steeds, but still try to bait them out before playing Lynessa, who should just win you the game.
    * Taunt Druid - This is probably the toughest druid match, and whether I won depended on whether I drew Skulking Geist or not. Equality + Pyro is only good the first time they kill their Hadranox, since after they cube it, clearing their board will only summon more Hadranoxes. You want to pressure them enough with cards like Tirion, Lich King, and Tarim so that they need to use cards like Branching Paths for armor instead of drawing. Finally, if they use up both Naturalizes, a late game Lynessa insta-wins the game because their taunts cannot deal with it, and you can summon the 4 horsemen while being protected by Lynessa. 
    *Token Druid - Easiest matchup by far. All you need is a Wild Pyro and a Sound the Bells, or some Consecrations, and you win the game. Don’t use hero powers to play around a big Spreading Plague board, which is the only real way for them to win.

* Hunter - I usually mulligan for Skulking Geist since it’s really useful against both Spell, and Deathrattle Hunter, a Truesilver to contest Animal Companion, an Equality to contest the Spellstone, and a Vicious Scalehide to heal. 
    * Spell Hunter - The paladin hero power does a good job of dealing with a lot of hunter secrets like Freezing Trap and Explosive Trap, although it fares poorly against Wandering Monster. Rat trap is something to watch out for, since Control Paladin typically plays 3 cards or more in the late game, especially with Sound the bells. Unless they get a Rexxar off pretty quickly, Control Paladin should usually win the game definitively. The problem with Rexxar is that they can get rush + poisonous zombeasts, or Ironbeak Owl, making your Lynessa useless. My game plan against this deck is to survive the first few turns, the Animal Companion, the Spell Stone, the To my Side!, until turn 8 and then just be aggressive as possible to win before they make too many zombeasts. 
    *Deathrattle Hunter - This deck feels like a worse version of Cubelock, and yet is still reliant on Skulking Geist to remove Play Dead. If you get geist on time, Paladin is heavily favored. If not, I feel like the Hunter is slightly favored, since it’s hard to deal with multiple Charging Devilsaurs and also a Kathrena around turn 8-9. Even if you Sunkeeper Tarim, the Kathrena will summon another big beast. Consider adding Aldor Peacekeeper if this deck is being too troublesome.

* Mage - Mage has two very different archetypes, making the mulligan very hard. I usually mulligan against tempo mage, since Big Spell mage gives me more time to draw through my deck if I guessed incorrectly. I usually try to find Vicious Scalehide, Equality, Truesilver, and Stonehill Defender. 
    * Tempo Mage - I think that if Control Paladin is going first, then the mage is heavily favored. The coin is very important to counter Counterspell and get your buffs off. Getting Blessing of Kings off on Vicious Scalehide is a must in this matchup, or otherwise you are dead before you can ever get to Uther of The Ebon Blade. Watch out for Explosive runes killing the Vicious Scalehide! You want to value trade as much as possible in this matchup of course. Also consider Doomsayer as a good tech option. 
    * Big Spell Mage - This match up just comes down to getting the Mage to use up all the removal before playing Lynessa. This means being aggressive to pressure them to use up removal, and just discovering the biggest thing possible out of Stonehill Defender. Be wary of positioning for Tarim against Meteor, and try to Zola Elise if you can’t get the mage to use up all the removal by the time you get Lynessa. Once they’re out of removal, Lynessa should win the game, although they can stall her for awhile with Water Elementals and try to win via fatigue. You want to save you equalities specifically to kill a board full of Water Elementals. 

* Paladin - Unless Control Paladin suddenly takes ladder by storm, it’s safe to assume that you are up against Odd/Murloc Paladin. Mulligan for Truesilver, Scalehide, Wild Pyro, Consecration, firefly. Since you want all the early mana cost minions, keeping Witchwood Piper in your mulligans is fine. 
    * Murloc Paladin - Unless they get the nuts opening into a divine shield adaptation from Megasaur or the “give you minions divine shield” version of Unidentified Maul, it should be an easy matchup. Using one equality to clear the board around turns 4-5, and using scalehide and Truesilver to trade on board should win you the game. Try not to draw too much with Acolyte of Pain, since they can reload off of your reload. 
    * Odd Paladin - I think this is one of the easiest matchups for Control Paladin. You don’t even need equality, Wild Pyro itself can do the trick and remove their board turn after turn, and the deck has enough healing to survive the damage dealt. Save a Steed for after they play silence.

* Priest - Every Priest I faced on ladder has been Quest Priest. I haven't faced a single combo priest since the nerfs happened, so I’ll just focus on Quest Priest. 
    * Quest Priest - This is one of the toughest matchups. They can get Amara off before you kill them by being aggressive, they have Archbishop Benedictus so they will win in the late game and fatigue, and they have Mind Control to steal your Lynessa. The only way to beat Control Priest is by constantly pressuring them. I mulligan for Acolyte of Pain and Witchwood Piper to draw as much as possible since you will lose in fatigue anyway, and you don't want your opponent getting most of the cards in your deck. I also go face constantly, not trading against anything except for Bloodmage Thalnos to deny spirit lash heal, and maybe a Bone Drake with my weapon so that they can't value trade. By putting enough pressure, it may be possible to force them to play Amara without the Zola, and they may be forced to use up removal quickly and not have the removal/Mind control for Lynessa. Using Zola on Elise is great in this matchup. Once they go into Shadowreaper Anduin form, they can reduce your health very quickly with their hero power, so try to save some Uther swings or a Vicious Scalehide for the late game. 

* Rogue - Miracle Rogue along with Quest Rogue is probably the hardest matchup for Control Paladin, although Even and Odd Rogues are pretty easy to deal with. For mulligans, I always mulligan for Truesilver first and foremost, followed by Equality, Wild Pyro, and Vicious Scalehide. 
    * Even Rogue - I only faced Even Rogue twice on ladder, both with Control Paladin, so my experience is limited, but Paladin seems to be favored. Even Rogue wants a deal a lot of damage via spells, and Control Paladin has Scalehides and Uther to generate a lot of healing, so it can actively deny Even Rogue's win condition.
    * Miracle Rogue - This deck can basically burst you down from 25 health, and sap is just a brutal way to deal with Control Paladin's threats. Rogue has always been good at single target removal, and this is a deck that likes to play single big threats. It's almost impossible to kill the Rogue before they can kill you, so it's better to just play safe, try to remove their board of spiders whenever you can, play Geist to remove Cold Bloods, and use Scalehides to try to heal as much as possible.
    * Odd Rogue  - Another easy matchup for Control Paladin. Truesilver on 4 denies vicious fledgling and hench clan thug, and scalehide + blessing of kings can kill whatever they play on turns 4 or 5. Control Paladin has plenty of taunts to deny face damage and equality if things go out of hand. 
    * Quest Rogue - Another tough matchup. I only faced one Quest Rogue since the nerfs, and I won because of a couple misplays my opponent did, so I still don’t have much experience with the deck. From what I remember about pre-nerf Quest Rogue, the only way to win was to try to be as aggressive as possible. Since the Rogue’s damage potential got reduced, it might actually be possible to kill the quest rogue before they kill you. 

* Shaman - Like Mage, Shaman matches are also hard to mulligan for because Shaman has two very different archetypes that require two different game plans. I usually try to mulligan for Acolyte of pain, Truesilver, Stonehill Defender and Vicious Scalehide. Vicious Scalehide, Stonehill and Truesilver lets you compete for the board against Even shaman, and Acolyte gives you draw against Shudderwock Shaman.
    * Even Shaman - I only faced one Even Shaman on ladder, so my experience is a little limited, but the matchup seems to be in the favor of Control Paladin, since it can use AOE to shut down their early board, use truesilver and some minions to kill mid game threats like Fire elemental, and overwhelm them with Lynessa in the late game. Shaman only has two hard removals, so unless they get a couple Hexes or Earthen Shocks from the Hagatha hero power, Paladin should win. Honestly, you don’t even need Lynessa to win, since cards like Lich King and Uther do a lot of work. 
    * Shudderwock Shaman - Honestly this is my least favorite matchup. Shudderwock Shaman is definitely favored since they have so much draw, removal, healing, and ways to stall. The best way to win is the be as aggressive as possible, and try to not trade at all. Alternatively, you could try to cheese out a win by milling your opponent. Keep their Mana tide totems and buff their acolytes with steed or sound the bells. Then just deal a bunch of damage to the acolyte multiple times with cards like wild pyromancer to make them mill a bunch of cards in their deck, and also make their volcanos/healing rains useless. The only game I won against Shudderwock, I won by milling them. 

* Warlock - Warlock’s identity in the new meta is still developing so my analysis of the matchup might change soon. Honestly, since the nerfs, the entire Warlock class has been a mystery for me, so I don’t have any solid matchup advice yet. Also, like Mage and Shaman, Warlock has multiple archetypes like Zoo and Control that making mulligans difficult. I therefore typically mulligan for an Equality, Truesilver, Acolyte and either Stonehill or Scalehide.
    * Control Warlock - This is a tough matchup for Control Paladin because Control Warlock has a lot of removal, like Big Spell mage, and sometimes also run mountain giants for a lot of early pressure. Rin can be a big problem for Control Paladin, so if they start playing rin, it’s a good Idea to just start pressuring as fast as possible. This is honestly a matchup that I am still trying to figure out how to play, just like Even Warlock. 
    * Cubelock - This deck was the bane of Control Paladin pre-nerf, and although it is a little slower now, it is still a pretty bad matchup. I think Skulking Geist to remove dark pack is crucial, and you should tech in an Aldor to neutralize Mountain giants if cubelock is popular. I only cut Aldor from Control Paladin because I didn’t expect to face Warlock again so soon. Cubelock runs almost no hard removal, so your win condition is to try to summon a big Lynessa as quickly as possible. With the nerfs, Cubelock should be much slower, so it should be easier to get to Lynessa than in the previous metagame. 
    *Even Warlock - I haven't played it much on ladder, and people are still experiment with it, so I can’t say too much about it for now because I don’t want to give the wrong information. Aldor is a great tech if there are a lot of Evenlocks on ladder to neutralize those giants though.
    * Zoo Warlock - This is honestly one of the few tough aggressive/board centric matchups. This is because you often have to use all your board clears in the early game, and don’t have anything if they play Gul’dan.Thankfully, they seem to discard Gul’dan a lot.  Scalehides are the key to securing a good mid game and winning the match up. 

* Warrior - Last and maybe least, we have Warrior. I think that Control Paladin is favored against every type of Warrior except maybe a weird Dead Man’s Hand Warrior. Against Warrior, I mulligan for Acolyte of Pain, stonehill defender, Witchwood Piper and Truesilver Champion. 
    *Odd Taunt Warrior - The only removal they have are Shield Slams, Reckless Flurries and Brawls. Although Brawl can be a problem against Lynessa, Warrior should never be able to amass enough armor to kill a Lynessa with the other two. The Warrior will be trying to finish the Quest as fast as possible, and you want a bunch of draw so that you can generate a big Lynessa as fast as possible. Usually, Taunt Warrior has a terrible early game, so you don’t need removal at all until around turn 7, so just try to draw and buff minions as much as you can. Even if the Taunt Warrior finishes their Quest early, your dudes are great ways to prevent damage from their hero power, and you have enough healing to last a while. 
    * Taunt Warrior - Regular Taunt Warrior also runs Executes, so other than having to bait out a bit more removal, you play the matchup very similarly as Odd taunt warrior. Regular Taunt Warrior runs a lot of AOE removal which is usually ineffective against Control Paladin, and lots of their cards damage minions, so you should get plenty of draw from Acolyte. 
   * Even/Regular Recruit Warrior - Although this deck isn’t very popular, I thought I’d mention it anyway. Sometimes, this deck runs Dead Man’s Hand, gaining extra versions of Execute which can be an issue. Otherwise, they have some of the worst early game in Hearthstone, and you can use that to your advantage to pressure them to use their hard removal. They get a big power spike with Woecleaver on 8, so have a Tarim or Equality handy by then. In the end, they usually have a very limited amount of threats that they space out, allowing Paladin to deal with them easily. If they use up their Executes, they’re dead to Lynessa. 

I hope that this guide has inspired to you to check out Control Paladin in the new meta! It’s really fun to play and has been one of my personal favorites for a very long time. Like I said earlier though, there is still room for experimentation! I want to make this deck the best it can be, and I know that there are plenty of great deck builders out there who can improve upon my list. 

Enjoy!

",47,1527991324.0,8o2csj,False,"Hey guys, 
I've been playing hearthstone since just before Whispers of the Old Gods came out, and I just reached legend for the first time last month with a **62% winrate Control Paladin** deck! So I'm posting this guide to brag on Reddit, but also to discuss my thoughts and experiences about the post-nerf Witchwood metagame and the current state of Control Paladin. 

Here are my [Stats](https://imgur.com/a/993k6cQ) from rank 4 to legend.
Here is my [proof](https://imgur.com/a/0muV5le)  of legend.


**Why Control Paladin?**
So why Control Paladin?  I've been trying make Control Paladin work since Un'goro (with decent success actually, since I got to rank 5 for the first time with Control Pally) because although a lot of other classes were better for a control strategy, I just loved how powerful Paladin's equality + consecrate/pyro combos were to clear the board. Although it's essentially a two card twisting nether and doesn't even work against divine shield minions, unlike twisting nether, it is available from turn 3-4 onwards to stop early/midgame boards, and is only 4-6 mana so you can develop your own board after clearing theirs. Even aggro decks like Even Pally used this combo to gain board control. In the end, this is THE single biggest reason to play Control Pally imo. 

Control Paladin is also one of the few decks that can be dual natured. Against fast decks, you have the ability to play as the control deck, but against even slower decks like quest priest, you have the ability to play against the aggressive deck. This is because some of the deck’s best control tools, like Truesilver Champion, Sunkeeper Tarim, Blessing of Kings and Uther of the Ebon Blade are also *really* good at hitting face. Because of this, the deck is very adaptable to whatever you’re facing. Keep in mind that the deck’s aggressive strategy aims to win around turns 8-12, so against fast combo decks like Quest Rogue or Cubelock, it is still heavily unfavored.

There is one more reason why playing Control Paladin can be a good idea, and it is that people are not expecting it...The reason I had a +50% winrate with Control Pally from Un'goro to Pre-nerf Witchwood metas, which were ravaged by Quest Rogue, Jade Druid, Razakus Priest and Cubelock was that everyone who queued up against me mulliganed thinking I was gonna try to kill them by turn 5. I was able to play off of what every other Paladin deck in the meta was and use the surprise factor to my advantage. Even if Control Paladin becomes popular in this metagame, which I doubt, people queuing up against paladin need to decide whether it's Odd/murloc Paladin, or Control Paladin, and that can be very advantageous. 

**Why Now?**
The few advantages I listed about playing Control Paladin have been around for a while, so obviously they're not the reason why I my winrate suddenly jumped up from 52% to 62%. Nor do I think that it was just because I got a few lucky games. I played about 70 games from rank 5 to 2300 legend, which I recorded on my computer starting at rank 4, and I felt a significant improvement in the performance of this deck than in previous metas. For a long time, Control Pally struggled in the meta. I could win off of aggro decks a decent portion of the time, but my deck was inconsistent, the health regen was limited, I ran out of cards quickly, and the late game was terrible. However, after getting to the final version of my list, I got to legend from rank 4 to 2300 legend with a 62% winrate, the highest winrate of any deck I ever played, and I think there are a few reasons for that:
    * Cubelock and Quest rogue, both very strong against Control Pally, got nerfed.
    * With the exception of miragle rogue, there are not that many burst-heavy combo decks on ladder anymore. Maybe Quest rogue returns in the future, but even then it's burst potential got nerfed.
    * The Witchwood gave Control Paladin some really good tools that it needed to cover up it's weaknesses. Notably Vicious Scalehide and Sound the Bells!.
    * The post-nerf meta is much slower, giving Control Paladin enough time to build to its late game win condition.
    * Control Paladin actually has a late game win condition now, or it did since Kobolds and Katacombs (It's Lynessa).

I hope that I conveyed why Control Paladin did not do so well in previously (Cubelock and Quest Rogue), and why I think it can the potential do really well now (No Cubelock and Quest Rogue). There, that was a pretty simple TL;DR. 
Now let's get into the deck itself:

So first off, please keep in mind that I am, by no means, an expert deck builder. This final list I came up with isn’t perfect, and looking back, there are still things I would change. I’m not exactly sure what’s core and what can be cut, If you have a different opinion, please feel free to comment! Also, I know the name of this deck sucks. I didn’t want to generically call it Control Paladin, but Buff Paladin isn’t that good either. I’m working on the name and am open to suggestions! 

Also, I made this guide very long to explain as much as possible since a lot of people don’t play Control Paladin. Feel free to skip around and just see what cards/matchups you’re interested in. 

**Core Cards**

* Equality - As I stated earlier, I think this card is THE reason to play Control Paladin, and I am certain that the deck would not exist without this card. Simply put, having this card in your hand is going to win games, and you will lose others because you did not draw this card. You also need a Wild Pyro or Consecrate you combo with this most of the time, so be careful not to use them up and have nothing to combo with your equalities. 

* Vicious Scalehide -  I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/8cdgap/vicious_scalehide_is_the_sleeper_of_the_set/) on r/hearthstone near the very beginning of the Witchwood meta talking about how good Vicious Scalehide was in Control Paladin, and I still stand by the points that I made. This is the best buff target in the deck. The card’s lifesteal + rush ability mean that your buffs gain rush/lifesteal as well, and can trade with your opponent’s minions to gain board control and health. It is one of the few cards with lifesteal in the deck, so use it carefully. 

* Sound the Bells! - It can be used paired with Scalehide for the typical buff + lifesteal, in the early/late game, although Kings is usually better with Scalehide in the mid-game. This card is also AMAZING with Wild Pyromancer, because you get to buff you pyromancer, while also basically playing a warpath. This combo is great at dealing with medium sized boards with 3-5 health when you don’t want to use up an equality. It is also a good tool to get value trades with, or buff important minions out of some AOE range. Finally, against late game decks, you want to use this card as much as possible, because it will turn your Lynessa into a 23/41 beast. Overall, it is just very versatile and compliments the deck’s internal synergies very well. 

* Wild Pyromancer - This is a staple card in Control Paladin because of its combo potential with equality, with consecration for a 3 damage AOE, and even with Sound the Bells. This also combos well with Acolyte of pain, since any spell cast will draw you cards. Keeping this card in your hand is very important if you want to clear the board, so use it conservatively. Be careful though, because it also deals damage to your own board!  Proper use of this card is one of the most important things to learn to properly pilot a Control Paladin imo.

* Acolyte of Pain - I’m not entirely sure if this card is core or not, but I’m leaning towards at least one being core for now. Control Paladin relies on a lot of combos like pyro+equality to be able to clear the board and buff your minions to gain life, and Acolyte is a great card draw tool to consistently get these combos off. 

* Stonehill Defender - This card is a decent early game taunt, one of the few early game minions you want to play on curve, but can also generate late game threats to close out games. It generates cards like Tirion or Lich king that can bait out removal for your other Lich king, or more importantly, Lynessa. Don’t be afraid to pick those righteous protectors against aggro tho. 

* Zola the Gorgon - This cards exists primarily to combo with Lynessa since you can play them both in one turn. After exhausting their removal, there shouldn’t a single card in your opponent's deck that can stand up to a 19/41 Lynessa… and even if there is, you have another one! Sometimes, if you feel like your opponent may be able to remove both Lynessas, against a big spell mage for instance, it’s better to Get an extra copy of Elise instead.

* Blessing of Kings - This is a very important mid game card as it is the best card to combo with your Acolyte of pain, Stonehill defender, or especially vicious scalehide. Being able to trade with a 5/7 Acolyte of pain on 4 is a great way to control the board and draw cards, against a leokk or misha for example, and with Scalehide, you get a 5/7 rush/lifesteal, another very powerful way to restore health. 

* Consecration - This is a good early/mid game AOE tool, and combos well with equality and Wild Pyromancer. The benefit of using Consecration with equality over pyromancer is that although equality+pyromancer only costs 4 mana, equality + consecrate does not clear your board, so you can still attack with your minions after clearing their board, something really useful against taunt druid, for instance. It is this deck’s best early game response to token decks  since you often want to save Wild Pyro to combo with Sound the Bells. As with Wild pyro, be careful not to use it too quickly, because you might need it to proc your equality later. 

* Truesilver Champion - This is your best friend against Rogues and Spiteful Druids. It kills Auctioneers, it kills Hench Clan Thugs, it kills Vicious Fledglings, it kills the Fal’dorei Strider, it now kills the minions buffed by the rogue quest, and any other early game minion that most aggro decks use except Tar Creeper. 

* Spikeridged Steed - This is the most important buff in the deck because this is what gives Lynessa taunt. It is also an amazing tool against aggro decks and spiteful druid, although you should expect this to get silenced. Therefore, you should use steed on a minion you can value trade with immediately so that even if it does get silenced, you are not in a bad position. 

* Sunkeeper Tarim - If you’ve played against any aggressive paladin deck in the past year, you know how strong this card is. It turns out be a very good control tool as well, because you can buff up your dudes, your scalehides, etc, and make the best value trades ever. If you have a truesilver equipped, taking lets you kill any minion. Or, you can just buff everything and go face. This is one of the best dual-natured cards in the history of hearthstone. 

* Lynessa Sunsorrow - This card is THE late game win condition of this deck, allowing you to double dip on buff spells to generate up to a 23/41 taunt with deathrattle: summon 2 stegodons. This also the prime removal target in the deck, combing this will Zola gives extra insurance. Always try to get your opponent to expend as much silence/removal as possible before playing Lynessa though. 

* Uther of the Ebon Blade - He represents 15 damage, 20 healing, and free 2/2 minions for the rest of the game that demand removal. Control Paladin has a lot of taunt minions, so you can keep summoning horsemen behind the taunts, threatening to win with the apocalypse, demanding some immediate removal.

** Non-Core Inclusions**

* Firefly - I’m not sure if Firefly is a good fit for the deck, and am considering replacing this with either a doomsayer, or another late game bomb like Tirion. I originally added it because the 1 mana tokens are better buff targets than the 2 mana dudes, and the token are good with Tarim.

* Witchwood Piper - Acolyte of Pain isn’t enough for card draw, especially not for a deck so combo dependent, so since some of the best combo cards in the deck are some of the deck’s cheapest minions, I added Witchwood Piper to consistently draw either Wild Pyro or Vicious Scalehide.

* Elise the Trailblazer - I’m honestly just thinking of adding her to the core list, but I’m not, since you can still technically play Control Paladin without her. She is one of the best value tools in the deck, and a great way to deal with decks like Big Spell mage, Quest Priest, and sometimes even Spell Hunter since they can gain value with their zombeasts. Also, she’s the only 5 mana card in the deck, so dropping her on 5 can add decent board control or board pressure. If the board isn’t important, I’d save playing her until you have Zola. 

*Skulking Geist - This is one of the best tech cards in the game right now. Playing this against taunt druid to get rid of their naturalize, against deathrattle hunter to delete play dead, against spell hunter to delete hunter’s mark and tracking, against control/cubelock to delete dark pact, and against rouge to delete coldblood and deadly poison can be game winning in a lot of situations. It’s got a decent body as well.

* The Lich King - He’s a great late game minion that provides pressure and value while also baiting removal. A good lich King card like Death Grip or Frostmourne can be game winning.

**Other Cards to Consider**

* Corpsetaker - This is a solid drop on turn 4, since it will usually have taunt, divine shield and lifesteal. It’s a great card to buff and very solid against aggro decks. If you want to add corpsetakers, you should add most of the divine shield Minions I mention below, and maybe another lifesteal minion. 

* Righteous Protector - Instead of Firefly, Righteous protector can be includes as a one drop since the divine shield works well with buffs. I opted for firefly instead because providing 2 bodies is better for buffs and tarim.

* The Glass Knight - I ran this card at first just as a 4 mana 4/3 divine shield, and it ended up not being that good. Token decks can easily remove the divine shield and kill it, druid can pop the shield with it’s hero power, and mage has cards like arcane missiles to deal with it. The Glass knight is a great buff target, since that reduces the chances of it dying, and getting multiple divine shield from things like true silver gives you so many value trades. But that usually means having to wait until turns 8-10 to play it with kings or steed, and I feel like there are better things you can do.

* Bolvar, fireblood - Take this one with a grain of salt. I don’t own Bolvar, and have never played with him. From a theorycrafting perspective, he seems like a really good inclusion in the deck if you want to add corpse takers and other divine shield minions. He can gain attack quickly and be something people have to waste removal on. He also transitions well into a turn 6 steed. Try him out if you have him!

* Tirion Fordring - A great late game card that adds a lot of extra pressure to the deck. Be warned though that the Ashbringer often contests with Frostmourne and the Uther of the Ebon Blade, making playing these cards feel very awkward and reducing their full value. 

* Captain Greenskin - No Seriously, this card is pretty good in Control Paladin, and I ran him for a long time during KoFT when Bonemare was a thing. He’s another 5 drop in a deck that seriously lacks them, and is a great play after a turn 4 truesilver. His true value comes after playing Uther, because you get a 6/4 lifesteal weapon, meaning 24 damage and 24 healing. If you run Tirion, you will have a weapon to buff most of the time. 

* Aldor Peacekeeper - This has always been a good minion for control Paladin, but there are not that many minions to hit with this in the meta right now. Aldor should be a tech option against warlocks’ mountain giants and druids’ spiteful summoners, although Tarim does the job as well.

* Paragon of Light - This minion gains taunt and lifesteal when buffed, making it a prime blessing of kings target by you, and a silence target by your opponent. I used to run it, but took it out because I thought draw from Acolyte was better. This is still a good tech option against miracle rogues and aggro decks to give you more lifesteal and board pressure. 

* Baleful Banker - Specifically a tech against Quest Priest and Big Spell Mage, so that you can get another big threat, maybe even 3 Lynessas, and you don’t go into fatigue as quickly.

* Doomsayer - Doomsayer can be a good tech option against tempo mage since it can clear the early mana wyrm and can counter explosive runes.It is also decent against most aggro decks, but actively weakens the control matchup, and this deck already has a good matchup vs aggro.

*Blackwald Sprite - For those of you who want to cheese games with Uther’s hero power. If you have 2 horsemen on board, you can instantly summon 2 more and cheese out a win from your unsuspecting opponent. It’s a good tech against control and the 3/4 body is good against aggro.

**Game Plan, Matchups & Mulligans**

Since this game plan of this deck relies on what kind of deck you facing, I’ll try to go over both at the same time:

* Druid - Since there are so many druid archetypes, it’s hard to know exactly what you’re up against, but I typically mulligan for skulking geist for taunt druid, an acolyte for draw, and a wild pyro in case it is spiteful or token druid. 
    * Combo/Malygos Druid - I only faced one combo druid on ladder, so while I don’t have much experience with the matchup, I would say that Control Paladin is favored. Druid naturally just sucks against big minions, and Control Paladin plays a bunch of big minions. Don’t hero power to play against spreading plague, and just hit face with your weapons, as there are very few things you need to trade with. You also have healing, so you can usually stay around 30 health. Ideally, the druid expends all their spells trying to kill your minions. 
    * Spiteful - I think I won against every Spiteful Druid I faced on ladder. I usually use an early equality to clear their board around turns 5-6, and I have Tarim and another equality to deal with any big spiteful minions. Control Paladin has enough healing to stay out of range of Leeroy, and has enough board control tools to win the game. Be wary of silence whenever you play Steeds, but still try to bait them out before playing Lynessa, who should just win you the game.
    * Taunt Druid - This is probably the toughest druid match, and whether I won depended on whether I drew Skulking Geist or not. Equality + Pyro is only good the first time they kill their Hadranox, since after they cube it, clearing their board will only summon more Hadranoxes. You want to pressure them enough with cards like Tirion, Lich King, and Tarim so that they need to use cards like Branching Paths for armor instead of drawing. Finally, if they use up both Naturalizes, a late game Lynessa insta-wins the game because their taunts cannot deal with it, and you can summon the 4 horsemen while being protected by Lynessa. 
    *Token Druid - Easiest matchup by far. All you need is a Wild Pyro and a Sound the Bells, or some Consecrations, and you win the game. Don’t use hero powers to play around a big Spreading Plague board, which is the only real way for them to win.

* Hunter - I usually mulligan for Skulking Geist since it’s really useful against both Spell, and Deathrattle Hunter, a Truesilver to contest Animal Companion, an Equality to contest the Spellstone, and a Vicious Scalehide to heal. 
    * Spell Hunter - The paladin hero power does a good job of dealing with a lot of hunter secrets like Freezing Trap and Explosive Trap, although it fares poorly against Wandering Monster. Rat trap is something to watch out for, since Control Paladin typically plays 3 cards or more in the late game, especially with Sound the bells. Unless they get a Rexxar off pretty quickly, Control Paladin should usually win the game definitively. The problem with Rexxar is that they can get rush + poisonous zombeasts, or Ironbeak Owl, making your Lynessa useless. My game plan against this deck is to survive the first few turns, the Animal Companion, the Spell Stone, the To my Side!, until turn 8 and then just be aggressive as possible to win before they make too many zombeasts. 
    *Deathrattle Hunter - This deck feels like a worse version of Cubelock, and yet is still reliant on Skulking Geist to remove Play Dead. If you get geist on time, Paladin is heavily favored. If not, I feel like the Hunter is slightly favored, since it’s hard to deal with multiple Charging Devilsaurs and also a Kathrena around turn 8-9. Even if you Sunkeeper Tarim, the Kathrena will summon another big beast. Consider adding Aldor Peacekeeper if this deck is being too troublesome.

* Mage - Mage has two very different archetypes, making the mulligan very hard. I usually mulligan against tempo mage, since Big Spell mage gives me more time to draw through my deck if I guessed incorrectly. I usually try to find Vicious Scalehide, Equality, Truesilver, and Stonehill Defender. 
    * Tempo Mage - I think that if Control Paladin is going first, then the mage is heavily favored. The coin is very important to counter Counterspell and get your buffs off. Getting Blessing of Kings off on Vicious Scalehide is a must in this matchup, or otherwise you are dead before you can ever get to Uther of The Ebon Blade. Watch out for Explosive runes killing the Vicious Scalehide! You want to value trade as much as possible in this matchup of course. Also consider Doomsayer as a good tech option. 
    * Big Spell Mage - This match up just comes down to getting the Mage to use up all the removal before playing Lynessa. This means being aggressive to pressure them to use up removal, and just discovering the biggest thing possible out of Stonehill Defender. Be wary of positioning for Tarim against Meteor, and try to Zola Elise if you can’t get the mage to use up all the removal by the time you get Lynessa. Once they’re out of removal, Lynessa should win the game, although they can stall her for awhile with Water Elementals and try to win via fatigue. You want to save you equalities specifically to kill a board full of Water Elementals. 

* Paladin - Unless Control Paladin suddenly takes ladder by storm, it’s safe to assume that you are up against Odd/Murloc Paladin. Mulligan for Truesilver, Scalehide, Wild Pyro, Consecration, firefly. Since you want all the early mana cost minions, keeping Witchwood Piper in your mulligans is fine. 
    * Murloc Paladin - Unless they get the nuts opening into a divine shield adaptation from Megasaur or the “give you minions divine shield” version of Unidentified Maul, it should be an easy matchup. Using one equality to clear the board around turns 4-5, and using scalehide and Truesilver to trade on board should win you the game. Try not to draw too much with Acolyte of Pain, since they can reload off of your reload. 
    * Odd Paladin - I think this is one of the easiest matchups for Control Paladin. You don’t even need equality, Wild Pyro itself can do the trick and remove their board turn after turn, and the deck has enough healing to survive the damage dealt. Save a Steed for after they play silence.

* Priest - Every Priest I faced on ladder has been Quest Priest. I haven't faced a single combo priest since the nerfs happened, so I’ll just focus on Quest Priest. 
    * Quest Priest - This is one of the toughest matchups. They can get Amara off before you kill them by being aggressive, they have Archbishop Benedictus so they will win in the late game and fatigue, and they have Mind Control to steal your Lynessa. The only way to beat Control Priest is by constantly pressuring them. I mulligan for Acolyte of Pain and Witchwood Piper to draw as much as possible since you will lose in fatigue anyway, and you don't want your opponent getting most of the cards in your deck. I also go face constantly, not trading against anything except for Bloodmage Thalnos to deny spirit lash heal, and maybe a Bone Drake with my weapon so that they can't value trade. By putting enough pressure, it may be possible to force them to play Amara without the Zola, and they may be forced to use up removal quickly and not have the removal/Mind control for Lynessa. Using Zola on Elise is great in this matchup. Once they go into Shadowreaper Anduin form, they can reduce your health very quickly with their hero power, so try to save some Uther swings or a Vicious Scalehide for the late game. 

* Rogue - Miracle Rogue along with Quest Rogue is probably the hardest matchup for Control Paladin, although Even and Odd Rogues are pretty easy to deal with. For mulligans, I always mulligan for Truesilver first and foremost, followed by Equality, Wild Pyro, and Vicious Scalehide. 
    * Even Rogue - I only faced Even Rogue twice on ladder, both with Control Paladin, so my experience is limited, but Paladin seems to be favored. Even Rogue wants a deal a lot of damage via spells, and Control Paladin has Scalehides and Uther to generate a lot of healing, so it can actively deny Even Rogue's win condition.
    * Miracle Rogue - This deck can basically burst you down from 25 health, and sap is just a brutal way to deal with Control Paladin's threats. Rogue has always been good at single target removal, and this is a deck that likes to play single big threats. It's almost impossible to kill the Rogue before they can kill you, so it's better to just play safe, try to remove their board of spiders whenever you can, play Geist to remove Cold Bloods, and use Scalehides to try to heal as much as possible.
    * Odd Rogue  - Another easy matchup for Control Paladin. Truesilver on 4 denies vicious fledgling and hench clan thug, and scalehide + blessing of kings can kill whatever they play on turns 4 or 5. Control Paladin has plenty of taunts to deny face damage and equality if things go out of hand. 
    * Quest Rogue - Another tough matchup. I only faced one Quest Rogue since the nerfs, and I won because of a couple misplays my opponent did, so I still don’t have much experience with the deck. From what I remember about pre-nerf Quest Rogue, the only way to win was to try to be as aggressive as possible. Since the Rogue’s damage potential got reduced, it might actually be possible to kill the quest rogue before they kill you. 

* Shaman - Like Mage, Shaman matches are also hard to mulligan for because Shaman has two very different archetypes that require two different game plans. I usually try to mulligan for Acolyte of pain, Truesilver, Stonehill Defender and Vicious Scalehide. Vicious Scalehide, Stonehill and Truesilver lets you compete for the board against Even shaman, and Acolyte gives you draw against Shudderwock Shaman.
    * Even Shaman - I only faced one Even Shaman on ladder, so my experience is a little limited, but the matchup seems to be in the favor of Control Paladin, since it can use AOE to shut down their early board, use truesilver and some minions to kill mid game threats like Fire elemental, and overwhelm them with Lynessa in the late game. Shaman only has two hard removals, so unless they get a couple Hexes or Earthen Shocks from the Hagatha hero power, Paladin should win. Honestly, you don’t even need Lynessa to win, since cards like Lich King and Uther do a lot of work. 
    * Shudderwock Shaman - Honestly this is my least favorite matchup. Shudderwock Shaman is definitely favored since they have so much draw, removal, healing, and ways to stall. The best way to win is the be as aggressive as possible, and try to not trade at all. Alternatively, you could try to cheese out a win by milling your opponent. Keep their Mana tide totems and buff their acolytes with steed or sound the bells. Then just deal a bunch of damage to the acolyte multiple times with cards like wild pyromancer to make them mill a bunch of cards in their deck, and also make their volcanos/healing rains useless. The only game I won against Shudderwock, I won by milling them. 

* Warlock - Warlock’s identity in the new meta is still developing so my analysis of the matchup might change soon. Honestly, since the nerfs, the entire Warlock class has been a mystery for me, so I don’t have any solid matchup advice yet. Also, like Mage and Shaman, Warlock has multiple archetypes like Zoo and Control that making mulligans difficult. I therefore typically mulligan for an Equality, Truesilver, Acolyte and either Stonehill or Scalehide.
    * Control Warlock - This is a tough matchup for Control Paladin because Control Warlock has a lot of removal, like Big Spell mage, and sometimes also run mountain giants for a lot of early pressure. Rin can be a big problem for Control Paladin, so if they start playing rin, it’s a good Idea to just start pressuring as fast as possible. This is honestly a matchup that I am still trying to figure out how to play, just like Even Warlock. 
    * Cubelock - This deck was the bane of Control Paladin pre-nerf, and although it is a little slower now, it is still a pretty bad matchup. I think Skulking Geist to remove dark pack is crucial, and you should tech in an Aldor to neutralize Mountain giants if cubelock is popular. I only cut Aldor from Control Paladin because I didn’t expect to face Warlock again so soon. Cubelock runs almost no hard removal, so your win condition is to try to summon a big Lynessa as quickly as possible. With the nerfs, Cubelock should be much slower, so it should be easier to get to Lynessa than in the previous metagame. 
    *Even Warlock - I haven't played it much on ladder, and people are still experiment with it, so I can’t say too much about it for now because I don’t want to give the wrong information. Aldor is a great tech if there are a lot of Evenlocks on ladder to neutralize those giants though.
    * Zoo Warlock - This is honestly one of the few tough aggressive/board centric matchups. This is because you often have to use all your board clears in the early game, and don’t have anything if they play Gul’dan.Thankfully, they seem to discard Gul’dan a lot.  Scalehides are the key to securing a good mid game and winning the match up. 

* Warrior - Last and maybe least, we have Warrior. I think that Control Paladin is favored against every type of Warrior except maybe a weird Dead Man’s Hand Warrior. Against Warrior, I mulligan for Acolyte of Pain, stonehill defender, Witchwood Piper and Truesilver Champion. 
    *Odd Taunt Warrior - The only removal they have are Shield Slams, Reckless Flurries and Brawls. Although Brawl can be a problem against Lynessa, Warrior should never be able to amass enough armor to kill a Lynessa with the other two. The Warrior will be trying to finish the Quest as fast as possible, and you want a bunch of draw so that you can generate a big Lynessa as fast as possible. Usually, Taunt Warrior has a terrible early game, so you don’t need removal at all until around turn 7, so just try to draw and buff minions as much as you can. Even if the Taunt Warrior finishes their Quest early, your dudes are great ways to prevent damage from their hero power, and you have enough healing to last a while. 
    * Taunt Warrior - Regular Taunt Warrior also runs Executes, so other than having to bait out a bit more removal, you play the matchup very similarly as Odd taunt warrior. Regular Taunt Warrior runs a lot of AOE removal which is usually ineffective against Control Paladin, and lots of their cards damage minions, so you should get plenty of draw from Acolyte. 
   * Even/Regular Recruit Warrior - Although this deck isn’t very popular, I thought I’d mention it anyway. Sometimes, this deck runs Dead Man’s Hand, gaining extra versions of Execute which can be an issue. Otherwise, they have some of the worst early game in Hearthstone, and you can use that to your advantage to pressure them to use their hard removal. They get a big power spike with Woecleaver on 8, so have a Tarim or Equality handy by then. In the end, they usually have a very limited amount of threats that they space out, allowing Paladin to deal with them easily. If they use up their Executes, they’re dead to Lynessa. 

I hope that this guide has inspired to you to check out Control Paladin in the new meta! It’s really fun to play and has been one of my personal favorites for a very long time. Like I said earlier though, there is still room for experimentation! I want to make this deck the best it can be, and I know that there are plenty of great deck builders out there who can improve upon my list. 

Enjoy!

",0,"Hey guys, 
I've been playing hearthstone since just before Whispers of the Old Gods came out, and I just reached legend for the first time last month with a **62% winrate Control Paladin** deck! So I'm posting this guide to brag on Reddit, but also to discuss my thoughts and experiences about the post-nerf Witchwood metagame and the current state of Control Paladin. 

Here are my [Stats](https://imgur.com/a/993k6cQ) from rank 4 to legend.
Here is my [proof](https://imgur.com/a/0muV5le)  of legend.


**Why Control Paladin?**
So why Control Paladin?  I've been trying make Control Paladin work since Un'goro (with decent success actually, since I got to rank 5 for the first time with Control Pally) because although a lot of other classes were better for a control strategy, I just loved how powerful Paladin's equality + consecrate/pyro combos were to clear the board. Although it's essentially a two card twisting nether and doesn't even work against divine shield minions, unlike twisting nether, it is available from turn 3-4 onwards to stop early/midgame boards, and is only 4-6 mana so you can develop your own board after clearing theirs. Even aggro decks like Even Pally used this combo to gain board control. In the end, this is THE single biggest reason to play Control Pally imo. 

Control Paladin is also one of the few decks that can be dual natured. Against fast decks, you have the ability to play as the control deck, but against even slower decks like quest priest, you have the ability to play against the aggressive deck. This is because some of the deck’s best control tools, like Truesilver Champion, Sunkeeper Tarim, Blessing of Kings and Uther of the Ebon Blade are also *really* good at hitting face. Because of this, the deck is very adaptable to whatever you’re facing. Keep in mind that the deck’s aggressive strategy aims to win around turns 8-12, so against fast combo decks like Quest Rogue or Cubelock, it is still heavily unfavored.

There is one more reason why playing Control Paladin can be a good idea, and it is that people are not expecting it...The reason I had a +50% winrate with Control Pally from Un'goro to Pre-nerf Witchwood metas, which were ravaged by Quest Rogue, Jade Druid, Razakus Priest and Cubelock was that everyone who queued up against me mulliganed thinking I was gonna try to kill them by turn 5. I was able to play off of what every other Paladin deck in the meta was and use the surprise factor to my advantage. Even if Control Paladin becomes popular in this metagame, which I doubt, people queuing up against paladin need to decide whether it's Odd/murloc Paladin, or Control Paladin, and that can be very advantageous. 

**Why Now?**
The few advantages I listed about playing Control Paladin have been around for a while, so obviously they're not the reason why I my winrate suddenly jumped up from 52% to 62%. Nor do I think that it was just because I got a few lucky games. I played about 70 games from rank 5 to 2300 legend, which I recorded on my computer starting at rank 4, and I felt a significant improvement in the performance of this deck than in previous metas. For a long time, Control Pally struggled in the meta. I could win off of aggro decks a decent portion of the time, but my deck was inconsistent, the health regen was limited, I ran out of cards quickly, and the late game was terrible. However, after getting to the final version of my list, I got to legend from rank 4 to 2300 legend with a 62% winrate, the highest winrate of any deck I ever played, and I think there are a few reasons for that:
    * Cubelock and Quest rogue, both very strong against Control Pally, got nerfed.
    * With the exception of miragle rogue, there are not that many burst-heavy combo decks on ladder anymore. Maybe Quest rogue returns in the future, but even then it's burst potential got nerfed.
    * The Witchwood gave Control Paladin some really good tools that it needed to cover up it's weaknesses. Notably Vicious Scalehide and Sound the Bells!.
    * The post-nerf meta is much slower, giving Control Paladin enough time to build to its late game win condition.
    * Control Paladin actually has a late game win condition now, or it did since Kobolds and Katacombs (It's Lynessa).

I hope that I conveyed why Control Paladin did not do so well in previously (Cubelock and Quest Rogue), and why I think it can the potential do really well now (No Cubelock and Quest Rogue). There, that was a pretty simple TL;DR. 
Now let's get into the deck itself:

So first off, please keep in mind that I am, by no means, an expert deck builder. This final list I came up with isn’t perfect, and looking back, there are still things I would change. I’m not exactly sure what’s core and what can be cut, If you have a different opinion, please feel free to comment! Also, I know the name of this deck sucks. I didn’t want to generically call it Control Paladin, but Buff Paladin isn’t that good either. I’m working on the name and am open to suggestions! 

Also, I made this guide very long to explain as much as possible since a lot of people don’t play Control Paladin. Feel free to skip around and just see what cards/matchups you’re interested in. 

**Core Cards**

* Equality - As I stated earlier, I think this card is THE reason to play Control Paladin, and I am certain that the deck would not exist without this card. Simply put, having this card in your hand is going to win games, and you will lose others because you did not draw this card. You also need a Wild Pyro or Consecrate you combo with this most of the time, so be careful not to use them up and have nothing to combo with your equalities. 

* Vicious Scalehide -  I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/8cdgap/vicious_scalehide_is_the_sleeper_of_the_set/) on r/hearthstone near the very beginning of the Witchwood meta talking about how good Vicious Scalehide was in Control Paladin, and I still stand by the points that I made. This is the best buff target in the deck. The card’s lifesteal + rush ability mean that your buffs gain rush/lifesteal as well, and can trade with your opponent’s minions to gain board control and health. It is one of the few cards with lifesteal in the deck, so use it carefully. 

* Sound the Bells! - It can be used paired with Scalehide for the typical buff + lifesteal, in the early/late game, although Kings is usually better with Scalehide in the mid-game. This card is also AMAZING with Wild Pyromancer, because you get to buff you pyromancer, while also basically playing a warpath. This combo is great at dealing with medium sized boards with 3-5 health when you don’t want to use up an equality. It is also a good tool to get value trades with, or buff important minions out of some AOE range. Finally, against late game decks, you want to use this card as much as possible, because it will turn your Lynessa into a 23/41 beast. Overall, it is just very versatile and compliments the deck’s internal synergies very well. 

* Wild Pyromancer - This is a staple card in Control Paladin because of its combo potential with equality, with consecration for a 3 damage AOE, and even with Sound the Bells. This also combos well with Acolyte of pain, since any spell cast will draw you cards. Keeping this card in your hand is very important if you want to clear the board, so use it conservatively. Be careful though, because it also deals damage to your own board!  Proper use of this card is one of the most important things to learn to properly pilot a Control Paladin imo.

* Acolyte of Pain - I’m not entirely sure if this card is core or not, but I’m leaning towards at least one being core for now. Control Paladin relies on a lot of combos like pyro+equality to be able to clear the board and buff your minions to gain life, and Acolyte is a great card draw tool to consistently get these combos off. 

* Stonehill Defender - This card is a decent early game taunt, one of the few early game minions you want to play on curve, but can also generate late game threats to close out games. It generates cards like Tirion or Lich king that can bait out removal for your other Lich king, or more importantly, Lynessa. Don’t be afraid to pick those righteous protectors against aggro tho. 

* Zola the Gorgon - This cards exists primarily to combo with Lynessa since you can play them both in one turn. After exhausting their removal, there shouldn’t a single card in your opponent's deck that can stand up to a 19/41 Lynessa… and even if there is, you have another one! Sometimes, if you feel like your opponent may be able to remove both Lynessas, against a big spell mage for instance, it’s better to Get an extra copy of Elise instead.

* Blessing of Kings - This is a very important mid game card as it is the best card to combo with your Acolyte of pain, Stonehill defender, or especially vicious scalehide. Being able to trade with a 5/7 Acolyte of pain on 4 is a great way to control the board and draw cards, against a leokk or misha for example, and with Scalehide, you get a 5/7 rush/lifesteal, another very powerful way to restore health. 

* Consecration - This is a good early/mid game AOE tool, and combos well with equality and Wild Pyromancer. The benefit of using Consecration with equality over pyromancer is that although equality+pyromancer only costs 4 mana, equality + consecrate does not clear your board, so you can still attack with your minions after clearing their board, something really useful against taunt druid, for instance. It is this deck’s best early game response to token decks  since you often want to save Wild Pyro to combo with Sound the Bells. As with Wild pyro, be careful not to use it too quickly, because you might need it to proc your equality later. 

* Truesilver Champion - This is your best friend against Rogues and Spiteful Druids. It kills Auctioneers, it kills Hench Clan Thugs, it kills Vicious Fledglings, it kills the Fal’dorei Strider, it now kills the minions buffed by the rogue quest, and any other early game minion that most aggro decks use except Tar Creeper. 

* Spikeridged Steed - This is the most important buff in the deck because this is what gives Lynessa taunt. It is also an amazing tool against aggro decks and spiteful druid, although you should expect this to get silenced. Therefore, you should use steed on a minion you can value trade with immediately so that even if it does get silenced, you are not in a bad position. 

* Sunkeeper Tarim - If you’ve played against any aggressive paladin deck in the past year, you know how strong this card is. It turns out be a very good control tool as well, because you can buff up your dudes, your scalehides, etc, and make the best value trades ever. If you have a truesilver equipped, taking lets you kill any minion. Or, you can just buff everything and go face. This is one of the best dual-natured cards in the history of hearthstone. 

* Lynessa Sunsorrow - This card is THE late game win condition of this deck, allowing you to double dip on buff spells to generate up to a 23/41 taunt with deathrattle: summon 2 stegodons. This also the prime removal target in the deck, combing this will Zola gives extra insurance. Always try to get your opponent to expend as much silence/removal as possible before playing Lynessa though. 

* Uther of the Ebon Blade - He represents 15 damage, 20 healing, and free 2/2 minions for the rest of the game that demand removal. Control Paladin has a lot of taunt minions, so you can keep summoning horsemen behind the taunts, threatening to win with the apocalypse, demanding some immediate removal.

** Non-Core Inclusions**

* Firefly - I’m not sure if Firefly is a good fit for the deck, and am considering replacing this with either a doomsayer, or another late game bomb like Tirion. I originally added it because the 1 mana tokens are better buff targets than the 2 mana dudes, and the token are good with Tarim.

* Witchwood Piper - Acolyte of Pain isn’t enough for card draw, especially not for a deck so combo dependent, so since some of the best combo cards in the deck are some of the deck’s cheapest minions, I added Witchwood Piper to consistently draw either Wild Pyro or Vicious Scalehide.

* Elise the Trailblazer - I’m honestly just thinking of adding her to the core list, but I’m not, since you can still technically play Control Paladin without her. She is one of the best value tools in the deck, and a great way to deal with decks like Big Spell mage, Quest Priest, and sometimes even Spell Hunter since they can gain value with their zombeasts. Also, she’s the only 5 mana card in the deck, so dropping her on 5 can add decent board control or board pressure. If the board isn’t important, I’d save playing her until you have Zola. 

*Skulking Geist - This is one of the best tech cards in the game right now. Playing this against taunt druid to get rid of their naturalize, against deathrattle hunter to delete play dead, against spell hunter to delete hunter’s mark and tracking, against control/cubelock to delete dark pact, and against rouge to delete coldblood and deadly poison can be game winning in a lot of situations. It’s got a decent body as well.

* The Lich King - He’s a great late game minion that provides pressure and value while also baiting removal. A good lich King card like Death Grip or Frostmourne can be game winning.

**Other Cards to Consider**

* Corpsetaker - This is a solid drop on turn 4, since it will usually have taunt, divine shield and lifesteal. It’s a great card to buff and very solid against aggro decks. If you want to add corpsetakers, you should add most of the divine shield Minions I mention below, and maybe another lifesteal minion. 

* Righteous Protector - Instead of Firefly, Righteous protector can be includes as a one drop since the divine shield works well with buffs. I opted for firefly instead because providing 2 bodies is better for buffs and tarim.

* The Glass Knight - I ran this card at first just as a 4 mana 4/3 divine shield, and it ended up not being that good. Token decks can easily remove the divine shield and kill it, druid can pop the shield with it’s hero power, and mage has cards like arcane missiles to deal with it. The Glass knight is a great buff target, since that reduces the chances of it dying, and getting multiple divine shield from things like true silver gives you so many value trades. But that usually means having to wait until turns 8-10 to play it with kings or steed, and I feel like there are better things you can do.

* Bolvar, fireblood - Take this one with a grain of salt. I don’t own Bolvar, and have never played with him. From a theorycrafting perspective, he seems like a really good inclusion in the deck if you want to add corpse takers and other divine shield minions. He can gain attack quickly and be something people have to waste removal on. He also transitions well into a turn 6 steed. Try him out if you have him!

* Tirion Fordring - A great late game card that adds a lot of extra pressure to the deck. Be warned though that the Ashbringer often contests with Frostmourne and the Uther of the Ebon Blade, making playing these cards feel very awkward and reducing their full value. 

* Captain Greenskin - No Seriously, this card is pretty good in Control Paladin, and I ran him for a long time during KoFT when Bonemare was a thing. He’s another 5 drop in a deck that seriously lacks them, and is a great play after a turn 4 truesilver. His true value comes after playing Uther, because you get a 6/4 lifesteal weapon, meaning 24 damage and 24 healing. If you run Tirion, you will have a weapon to buff most of the time. 

* Aldor Peacekeeper - This has always been a good minion for control Paladin, but there are not that many minions to hit with this in the meta right now. Aldor should be a tech option against warlocks’ mountain giants and druids’ spiteful summoners, although Tarim does the job as well.

* Paragon of Light - This minion gains taunt and lifesteal when buffed, making it a prime blessing of kings target by you, and a silence target by your opponent. I used to run it, but took it out because I thought draw from Acolyte was better. This is still a good tech option against miracle rogues and aggro decks to give you more lifesteal and board pressure. 

* Baleful Banker - Specifically a tech against Quest Priest and Big Spell Mage, so that you can get another big threat, maybe even 3 Lynessas, and you don’t go into fatigue as quickly.

* Doomsayer - Doomsayer can be a good tech option against tempo mage since it can clear the early mana wyrm and can counter explosive runes.It is also decent against most aggro decks, but actively weakens the control matchup, and this deck already has a good matchup vs aggro.

*Blackwald Sprite - For those of you who want to cheese games with Uther’s hero power. If you have 2 horsemen on board, you can instantly summon 2 more and cheese out a win from your unsuspecting opponent. It’s a good tech against control and the 3/4 body is good against aggro.

**Game Plan, Matchups & Mulligans**

Since this game plan of this deck relies on what kind of deck you facing, I’ll try to go over both at the same time:

* Druid - Since there are so many druid archetypes, it’s hard to know exactly what you’re up against, but I typically mulligan for skulking geist for taunt druid, an acolyte for draw, and a wild pyro in case it is spiteful or token druid. 
    * Combo/Malygos Druid - I only faced one combo druid on ladder, so while I don’t have much experience with the matchup, I would say that Control Paladin is favored. Druid naturally just sucks against big minions, and Control Paladin plays a bunch of big minions. Don’t hero power to play against spreading plague, and just hit face with your weapons, as there are very few things you need to trade with. You also have healing, so you can usually stay around 30 health. Ideally, the druid expends all their spells trying to kill your minions. 
    * Spiteful - I think I won against every Spiteful Druid I faced on ladder. I usually use an early equality to clear their board around turns 5-6, and I have Tarim and another equality to deal with any big spiteful minions. Control Paladin has enough healing to stay out of range of Leeroy, and has enough board control tools to win the game. Be wary of silence whenever you play Steeds, but still try to bait them out before playing Lynessa, who should just win you the game.
    * Taunt Druid - This is probably the toughest druid match, and whether I won depended on whether I drew Skulking Geist or not. Equality + Pyro is only good the first time they kill their Hadranox, since after they cube it, clearing their board will only summon more Hadranoxes. You want to pressure them enough with cards like Tirion, Lich King, and Tarim so that they need to use cards like Branching Paths for armor instead of drawing. Finally, if they use up both Naturalizes, a late game Lynessa insta-wins the game because their taunts cannot deal with it, and you can summon the 4 horsemen while being protected by Lynessa. 
    *Token Druid - Easiest matchup by far. All you need is a Wild Pyro and a Sound the Bells, or some Consecrations, and you win the game. Don’t use hero powers to play around a big Spreading Plague board, which is the only real way for them to win.

* Hunter - I usually mulligan for Skulking Geist since it’s really useful against both Spell, and Deathrattle Hunter, a Truesilver to contest Animal Companion, an Equality to contest the Spellstone, and a Vicious Scalehide to heal. 
    * Spell Hunter - The paladin hero power does a good job of dealing with a lot of hunter secrets like Freezing Trap and Explosive Trap, although it fares poorly against Wandering Monster. Rat trap is something to watch out for, since Control Paladin typically plays 3 cards or more in the late game, especially with Sound the bells. Unless they get a Rexxar off pretty quickly, Control Paladin should usually win the game definitively. The problem with Rexxar is that they can get rush + poisonous zombeasts, or Ironbeak Owl, making your Lynessa useless. My game plan against this deck is to survive the first few turns, the Animal Companion, the Spell Stone, the To my Side!, until turn 8 and then just be aggressive as possible to win before they make too many zombeasts. 
    *Deathrattle Hunter - This deck feels like a worse version of Cubelock, and yet is still reliant on Skulking Geist to remove Play Dead. If you get geist on time, Paladin is heavily favored. If not, I feel like the Hunter is slightly favored, since it’s hard to deal with multiple Charging Devilsaurs and also a Kathrena around turn 8-9. Even if you Sunkeeper Tarim, the Kathrena will summon another big beast. Consider adding Aldor Peacekeeper if this deck is being too troublesome.

* Mage - Mage has two very different archetypes, making the mulligan very hard. I usually mulligan against tempo mage, since Big Spell mage gives me more time to draw through my deck if I guessed incorrectly. I usually try to find Vicious Scalehide, Equality, Truesilver, and Stonehill Defender. 
    * Tempo Mage - I think that if Control Paladin is going first, then the mage is heavily favored. The coin is very important to counter Counterspell and get your buffs off. Getting Blessing of Kings off on Vicious Scalehide is a must in this matchup, or otherwise you are dead before you can ever get to Uther of The Ebon Blade. Watch out for Explosive runes killing the Vicious Scalehide! You want to value trade as much as possible in this matchup of course. Also consider Doomsayer as a good tech option. 
    * Big Spell Mage - This match up just comes down to getting the Mage to use up all the removal before playing Lynessa. This means being aggressive to pressure them to use up removal, and just discovering the biggest thing possible out of Stonehill Defender. Be wary of positioning for Tarim against Meteor, and try to Zola Elise if you can’t get the mage to use up all the removal by the time you get Lynessa. Once they’re out of removal, Lynessa should win the game, although they can stall her for awhile with Water Elementals and try to win via fatigue. You want to save you equalities specifically to kill a board full of Water Elementals. 

* Paladin - Unless Control Paladin suddenly takes ladder by storm, it’s safe to assume that you are up against Odd/Murloc Paladin. Mulligan for Truesilver, Scalehide, Wild Pyro, Consecration, firefly. Since you want all the early mana cost minions, keeping Witchwood Piper in your mulligans is fine. 
    * Murloc Paladin - Unless they get the nuts opening into a divine shield adaptation from Megasaur or the “give you minions divine shield” version of Unidentified Maul, it should be an easy matchup. Using one equality to clear the board around turns 4-5, and using scalehide and Truesilver to trade on board should win you the game. Try not to draw too much with Acolyte of Pain, since they can reload off of your reload. 
    * Odd Paladin - I think this is one of the easiest matchups for Control Paladin. You don’t even need equality, Wild Pyro itself can do the trick and remove their board turn after turn, and the deck has enough healing to survive the damage dealt. Save a Steed for after they play silence.

* Priest - Every Priest I faced on ladder has been Quest Priest. I haven't faced a single combo priest since the nerfs happened, so I’ll just focus on Quest Priest. 
    * Quest Priest - This is one of the toughest matchups. They can get Amara off before you kill them by being aggressive, they have Archbishop Benedictus so they will win in the late game and fatigue, and they have Mind Control to steal your Lynessa. The only way to beat Control Priest is by constantly pressuring them. I mulligan for Acolyte of Pain and Witchwood Piper to draw as much as possible since you will lose in fatigue anyway, and you don't want your opponent getting most of the cards in your deck. I also go face constantly, not trading against anything except for Bloodmage Thalnos to deny spirit lash heal, and maybe a Bone Drake with my weapon so that they can't value trade. By putting enough pressure, it may be possible to force them to play Amara without the Zola, and they may be forced to use up removal quickly and not have the removal/Mind control for Lynessa. Using Zola on Elise is great in this matchup. Once they go into Shadowreaper Anduin form, they can reduce your health very quickly with their hero power, so try to save some Uther swings or a Vicious Scalehide for the late game. 

* Rogue - Miracle Rogue along with Quest Rogue is probably the hardest matchup for Control Paladin, although Even and Odd Rogues are pretty easy to deal with. For mulligans, I always mulligan for Truesilver first and foremost, followed by Equality, Wild Pyro, and Vicious Scalehide. 
    * Even Rogue - I only faced Even Rogue twice on ladder, both with Control Paladin, so my experience is limited, but Paladin seems to be favored. Even Rogue wants a deal a lot of damage via spells, and Control Paladin has Scalehides and Uther to generate a lot of healing, so it can actively deny Even Rogue's win condition.
    * Miracle Rogue - This deck can basically burst you down from 25 health, and sap is just a brutal way to deal with Control Paladin's threats. Rogue has always been good at single target removal, and this is a deck that likes to play single big threats. It's almost impossible to kill the Rogue before they can kill you, so it's better to just play safe, try to remove their board of spiders whenever you can, play Geist to remove Cold Bloods, and use Scalehides to try to heal as much as possible.
    * Odd Rogue  - Another easy matchup for Control Paladin. Truesilver on 4 denies vicious fledgling and hench clan thug, and scalehide + blessing of kings can kill whatever they play on turns 4 or 5. Control Paladin has plenty of taunts to deny face damage and equality if things go out of hand. 
    * Quest Rogue - Another tough matchup. I only faced one Quest Rogue since the nerfs, and I won because of a couple misplays my opponent did, so I still don’t have much experience with the deck. From what I remember about pre-nerf Quest Rogue, the only way to win was to try to be as aggressive as possible. Since the Rogue’s damage potential got reduced, it might actually be possible to kill the quest rogue before they kill you. 

* Shaman - Like Mage, Shaman matches are also hard to mulligan for because Shaman has two very different archetypes that require two different game plans. I usually try to mulligan for Acolyte of pain, Truesilver, Stonehill Defender and Vicious Scalehide. Vicious Scalehide, Stonehill and Truesilver lets you compete for the board against Even shaman, and Acolyte gives you draw against Shudderwock Shaman.
    * Even Shaman - I only faced one Even Shaman on ladder, so my experience is a little limited, but the matchup seems to be in the favor of Control Paladin, since it can use AOE to shut down their early board, use truesilver and some minions to kill mid game threats like Fire elemental, and overwhelm them with Lynessa in the late game. Shaman only has two hard removals, so unless they get a couple Hexes or Earthen Shocks from the Hagatha hero power, Paladin should win. Honestly, you don’t even need Lynessa to win, since cards like Lich King and Uther do a lot of work. 
    * Shudderwock Shaman - Honestly this is my least favorite matchup. Shudderwock Shaman is definitely favored since they have so much draw, removal, healing, and ways to stall. The best way to win is the be as aggressive as possible, and try to not trade at all. Alternatively, you could try to cheese out a win by milling your opponent. Keep their Mana tide totems and buff their acolytes with steed or sound the bells. Then just deal a bunch of damage to the acolyte multiple times with cards like wild pyromancer to make them mill a bunch of cards in their deck, and also make their volcanos/healing rains useless. The only game I won against Shudderwock, I won by milling them. 

* Warlock - Warlock’s identity in the new meta is still developing so my analysis of the matchup might change soon. Honestly, since the nerfs, the entire Warlock class has been a mystery for me, so I don’t have any solid matchup advice yet. Also, like Mage and Shaman, Warlock has multiple archetypes like Zoo and Control that making mulligans difficult. I therefore typically mulligan for an Equality, Truesilver, Acolyte and either Stonehill or Scalehide.
    * Control Warlock - This is a tough matchup for Control Paladin because Control Warlock has a lot of removal, like Big Spell mage, and sometimes also run mountain giants for a lot of early pressure. Rin can be a big problem for Control Paladin, so if they start playing rin, it’s a good Idea to just start pressuring as fast as possible. This is honestly a matchup that I am still trying to figure out how to play, just like Even Warlock. 
    * Cubelock - This deck was the bane of Control Paladin pre-nerf, and although it is a little slower now, it is still a pretty bad matchup. I think Skulking Geist to remove dark pack is crucial, and you should tech in an Aldor to neutralize Mountain giants if cubelock is popular. I only cut Aldor from Control Paladin because I didn’t expect to face Warlock again so soon. Cubelock runs almost no hard removal, so your win condition is to try to summon a big Lynessa as quickly as possible. With the nerfs, Cubelock should be much slower, so it should be easier to get to Lynessa than in the previous metagame. 
    *Even Warlock - I haven't played it much on ladder, and people are still experiment with it, so I can’t say too much about it for now because I don’t want to give the wrong information. Aldor is a great tech if there are a lot of Evenlocks on ladder to neutralize those giants though.
    * Zoo Warlock - This is honestly one of the few tough aggressive/board centric matchups. This is because you often have to use all your board clears in the early game, and don’t have anything if they play Gul’dan.Thankfully, they seem to discard Gul’dan a lot.  Scalehides are the key to securing a good mid game and winning the match up. 

* Warrior - Last and maybe least, we have Warrior. I think that Control Paladin is favored against every type of Warrior except maybe a weird Dead Man’s Hand Warrior. Against Warrior, I mulligan for Acolyte of Pain, stonehill defender, Witchwood Piper and Truesilver Champion. 
    *Odd Taunt Warrior - The only removal they have are Shield Slams, Reckless Flurries and Brawls. Although Brawl can be a problem against Lynessa, Warrior should never be able to amass enough armor to kill a Lynessa with the other two. The Warrior will be trying to finish the Quest as fast as possible, and you want a bunch of draw so that you can generate a big Lynessa as fast as possible. Usually, Taunt Warrior has a terrible early game, so you don’t need removal at all until around turn 7, so just try to draw and buff minions as much as you can. Even if the Taunt Warrior finishes their Quest early, your dudes are great ways to prevent damage from their hero power, and you have enough healing to last a while. 
    * Taunt Warrior - Regular Taunt Warrior also runs Executes, so other than having to bait out a bit more removal, you play the matchup very similarly as Odd taunt warrior. Regular Taunt Warrior runs a lot of AOE removal which is usually ineffective against Control Paladin, and lots of their cards damage minions, so you should get plenty of draw from Acolyte. 
   * Even/Regular Recruit Warrior - Although this deck isn’t very popular, I thought I’d mention it anyway. Sometimes, this deck runs Dead Man’s Hand, gaining extra versions of Execute which can be an issue. Otherwise, they have some of the worst early game in Hearthstone, and you can use that to your advantage to pressure them to use their hard removal. They get a big power spike with Woecleaver on 8, so have a Tarim or Equality handy by then. In the end, they usually have a very limited amount of threats that they space out, allowing Paladin to deal with them easily. If they use up their Executes, they’re dead to Lynessa. 

I hope that this guide has inspired to you to check out Control Paladin in the new meta! It’s really fun to play and has been one of my personal favorites for a very long time. Like I said earlier though, there is still room for experimentation! I want to make this deck the best it can be, and I know that there are plenty of great deck builders out there who can improve upon my list. 

Enjoy!

"OK, I'm technically kind of to blame here because of my post on thetrailing3.com where I mentioned ""hypothetical"" trade scenarios with this. However, I learned today that some boards are saying ""Mavs packaging No. 5 for Tatum"" and it's just a huge mess. 

Let me clear this up to the best of my ability.

This needs to be cleared up:

The #Mavs aren't ""looking"" to package anything with the Celtics. People are either not reading all of the sportingnews.com article or are just irresponsibly adding to it.

The article LITERALLY SAYS this. Stay with me:

- Boston likes Bamba and has options
- Dallas and Memphis (No. 5 and No. 4) are in the range Boston would need to be to pick Bamba IF IT WANTED TO MOVE UP.
- The author (Sean Deveney) SPECULATES (read that again, SPECULATES) that Boston's current No. 27 pick wouldn't be enough to move up by itself.
- Dallas and Memphis are ""ready to deal."" Yes, this is true. Cuban is on record as saying the #Mavs are open to trading the pick. He's also added, on the record, that it's a LONG SHOT.
- Deveney then SPECULATES that it would likely take Boston's No. 27 pick, either Jaylen Brown/Terry Rozier and one of Boston's 2019 picks (from MEM/SAC), if not both, to make a deal work. Again, THIS IS ALL SPECULATION.

OK, with me so far? So then Mike Fisher checked with his own NBA sources who said Deveney is accurate about Boston's Bamba interest. However, the #Mavs sources via Fisher were unaware of Boston's interest.

Read that again: UNAWARE OF BOSTON'S INTEREST.

Last thing: Fisher said that Dallas would COUNTER any Boston off with asking for Tatum. That's IT.

Dallas is NOT ""looking to package"" anything. There's a difference between my last quote from Fisher and ""looking to package"" the No. 5 pick for a player like Jayson Tatum.

Didn't mean this to sound super frustrated, but it's important to get these terms/conditions/words right.

" I don't mean like DMs who are new to DMing and make a few mistakes here and there. Missed triggers on attacks, or failure to mention something in a puzzle room is fine with me. I mean like DMs who:

* A DM who gets upset that the level 4 rogue never gets hit because they use cunning action to hide. When they have 1/5th of the HP that the party tank does. (Party tank was a Barbarian who was always front and center- often yelling loudly)

* Who then says that the two rogues at the table now cannot use the **cunning action** *(the level three class feat in PHB)* to hide. Ever. Partially because ""Sneak-attack damage is a broken mechanic"". And so the rogues could get hit more often.

* Plus side, DM gave *super magical items* to each party member. Made a big deal out of the uniqueness of these items. (Something along the lines of: Warlock- Staff of fire, Barbarian- Magic bracers, Cleric- Giant great sword, Rogue 1- Poison dagger, Wizard- Bag of holding, and Rogue 2... a +1 shortbow.) 

* Down side, a few sessions later, gave +2 longbow to the wizard. Because Rogue 2 was a halfling ""And couldn't use it anyway"".

 * When one of the rogue characters die, blame the player for not ""playing it safe""

* After creating a new character, the DM had the player re-start at level 1. When the rest of the group was level 5 at that point. (We had all started at level 1 initially)

* Cue another character shortly after. Blamed ""Unlucky dice"" on that one.

* On the 3rd new character, was allowed to start at party level -1. Which the player was fine with. 

* Dm then disallows any Bardic spell not directly related to combat. After player made a tool-kit knowledge Bard.

* Be me, realizing the DM just didn't like the me in the group.



Super frustrating to deal with. I don't have that many people in the area interested and have tried online/coworkers/local game store, and to no avail. I would rather not deal with this bullshit and quit D&D for now. 


Anyone have similar issues? Anyone know how to resolve these issues? I'm going to work soon, so I'll read any responses later and reply if I can. Thanks!

"So to my delight i woke up and found out my parents were outside shopping, i took this as an opportunity to look for some food to gorge on. I went down to the basement where only my parents live and found a whole plate of shrimp and broccoli takeout left in the fridge from last night, score. Next to it were marshmallows so i thought hey why dont i use tea biscuits and some hersheys kisses to make a smore while i wait for my food to heat up. While I see my marshmallow turn a delightful golden brown over the stove im rudely interrupted by the sound of foot steps going down the stairs, i knew judging by the cadence and thud of the steps that it was my little brother. *fuck*.

I didnt have enough time to dispose of the evidence and either way i was in the kitchen with tea biscuits and open hersheys kisses on the table top, the memory of him telling my parents about me microwaving a frozen burrito forcing me to tell them i was only thawing it out for when we could eat rushed into my subconscious, i knew i had to think of something. His maddening squeaky voice interrupts the chaotic brainstorming of excuses as he says ""arent you fasting"". I didnt let this phase me, i continued assembling the smore as if i was doing nothing wrong, ""yes"" I said as i put the smore into the freezer ""i just wanna know what a frozen smore tastes like when we eat :)"". Like the annoying imitator he is he decides he'd like to do it too so I think fuck it whatever I'll make another one and throw it in the freezer, everything was alright, he doesnt suspect a thing. Or so I thought.

Behind me I hear him unwrap the kisses and move towards the microwave *fuck fuck fuck the shrimp and broccoli is in the microwave*. I stop him and ask what hes doing ""its better if you melt it in the microwave for 5 seconds"" and before i could contest he open the microwave door, I'm done for. 

I freeze and my heart jumps into my throat, hes gonna snitch, im fucked, im gonna have to deal with my damn ignorant parents. But his reaction isnt as expected, normally he'd run to his phone and call my parents but he looks more puzzled than anything. I forgot one crucial detail, hes a dumbass, he didnt connect the food to me and motioned to take it out. The heat from the plate would most definitely connect me to the food however so I yelled out ""dont touch it, its probably ahmed's"" who happens to be my eldest brother who has already told our parents hes an atheist and dealt with their protests/passive aggressive gestures for months. 

He nodded and went upstairs to microwave the chocolate, i finish roasting his marshmallow and assemble the smore. I thought this was the end of it, he'd go back upstairs to his room and i could scarf down my food in peace alone in the basement, i thought wrong. I underestimated his ability to burden my existence, he replied to my request for him to go back upstairs with ""no im bored"" and followed me around the house for upwards of half an hour while my food got cold in the microwave. Fuckin asshole.

Eventually he left me alone and i was able to sneak the food into my room in a black plastic bag, the food was lukewarm but still edible, definitely not worth the trials and tribulations of acquiring it though.

"I had always been aware that my dad could astral project, but it seemed kinda normal to me, I didn't really know any different. He has been very sick since he was born, so he always thought maybe that's why he could do this. He used to hop in bed at night then leave his body and check round the house to make sure everything was secure and that my sister and I were safe. He can't make himself leave his body but he can control what he does once he's out and has also said sometimes even if it seems like only a couple of minutes, he gets this feeling like he's been out too long and he hates those times cause he ends up ""slammed"" back into his body and feels like crap for the next day or so. 

Anyway, when I was 17 he went in for open heart surgery. He was very sick, had lost a lot of weight and was very weak by the time they did the surgery, so ended up having to be resuscitated twice during. When he came home from hospital, I took a few days off course so I could be home to help if need be, as he was only allowed out of bed to use the bathroom and little walks round the house at first. 

So one afternoon while my sister was at school, I checked on dad who was fast asleep with his tv going and went back up the other end of the house to watch a movie. I fell asleep on the couch. I have no idea how long I was asleep but was suddenly woken up when dad grabbed hold of my foot and shook it. I jumped and said ""omg what?!"" And he just looked at me like he was really annoyed  and said ""HELP ME"" in that irritated parent tone when they've been calling your name for ages and you haven't responded, so I was immediately stroppy. i sat up and said ""ok but you could've woken me nicely"". He turned his back and walked off into the kitchen. I followed him and he wasn't there so I called out ""where are you?"" No answer so I checked up the hallway. 

I got halfway up the hall when I suddenly clicked what I'd just seen. Dad that shook me awake was wearing a blue t shirt, was his normal size and had flicky hair that needed a cut. My dad that I had just realised was on bed rest, was unable to wear shirts yet as they irritated his scar, was 30kg lighter and I had just shaved his head for him the day before. 

I started to panic at what I might find, but I calmed myself down and popped my head into his room. He was in a heap on the floor, holding his chest and trying to breath. I tend to go into mummy mode when scary stuffs happening, so I calmly got down on the floor with him and helped sit him up so he could breath, then hauled him back up into bed. 

He was clearly embarrassed and wouldn't look at me, but said thanks. I sat with him for a bit watching TV (he hates being babied so I didn't wanna do the whole ""are you ok"" ""what happened"" ""what can I get for you) . After a few minutes he said ""sorry about that"". I told him it was totally fine, it just gave me a fright but that I was happy he was alright. Then he said ""I just wanted to make myself a coffee, but I stood up and got dizzy and when I landed on my knees it jolted me chest. I'm sorry for giving you fright, I just had to do it"" I said I understood that he just wanted to get a drink and that I didn't mind helping him up, it was just an accident.

He gave me a sideways look and said ""yeah, but I didnt wanna have to come get you like that, I just couldn't catch my breath to call out"". I got cold chills down my back and my eyes welled up. Being so worried when I found him, I had forgotten he had come and gotten me. I literally said to him ""that's very cool....but don't do that again ay"" and he cracked up laughing which made his chest hurt worse lol

We’re outside roasting marshmallows and enjoying company, when I mention to my cousin that our former high school track team got bumped down to a lower division. We keep talking about this because we were both track athletes, and care about the future of the program (they suck btw). All of a sudden, my father snaps at me. “High school was years ago. Fucking get over it.” This caught me off guard because he usually loves hearing about all of the track drama. So I’m thrown off guard already.

"As the downpour begins I curse at myself. Why hadn’t I checked the weather before departing on my three-day camping trip, deep in the woods? I hadn’t even invested in a high quality tent.  

I’m running further into the trees, trying to get as much cover as I can, when I see the lights of a cabin. The sun is almost completely down and I have no clue when the rain is going to let up. I could be in store for a miserable night. Fuck it, I say to myself, and I break for the cabin. 

I try not to bang too loudly, as I don’t want to scare the inhabitants. The door swings  open after a few seconds, and I find myself face to face with a fairly normal looking man. 

“Oooh, real nasty one out there,” he says. “You can stay here tonight if you like.”

My jaw falls open in gratitude. What a kind man, offering a place to stay before I can even ask.

“I don’t want to be a bother,” I say, but he waves me off. 

“Nonsense. It gets lonely out here.” 

I say that I bet it does, and we head inside.

As he places the dinner he’s prepared in front of me, he hands me a fork. He apologizes and tells me that all his knives have gone missing. 

“Aren’t you the only one who lives here, though?” I ask with a slight laugh. 

He says that he can be very forgetful sometimes and changes the subject. 

-----------------

After dinner I help with dishes. Then I thank him again for his hospitality before retiring to the guest bedroom he has made up for me. 

The kitchen light, coming under the bedroom door and into my room, turns off shortly afterwards. I hear my host retire to bed. 

I fall asleep immediately, exhausted by a long day of hiking.

What’s that? From the kitchen I hear something sharp and unpleasant. It’s a familiar sound. 

I tilt my head, listening closer. The sound is unmistakable. Someone is sharpening a knife in the kitchen. My heart races in my chest and I try to reason with myself that it’s surely innocuous. My flight instincts are overbearing, though, and I scan the room for another exit, just in case. The window is plenty wide for me. 

Suddenly the sharpening stops. The kitchen is still for a moment, and so am I. I hear slow footsteps begin to head towards my room. I hold my breath. 

The footsteps stop outside of the door. I sit motionless for two minutes, hearing nothing. Finally, the steps move away, and the sound of sharpening resumes. 

I decide that a little rain never hurt anybody. I quietly gather my stuff, open the window, and sneak out into the night air.

"I've been in the ticket verification ""beta"" group for a month and a half. Last night I went to see Action Point. Upon checking in I didn't get the pop-up verification notice, and also was not prompted for a photo. Thought it was strange, so I took a [screenshot of the check-in confirmation screen](https://i.imgur.com/Y1b3Pky.jpg).

I was not prompted for a picture when relaunching the app later last night. This morning, still no prompt. So I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, got the prompt, and uploaded the photo. A couple hours later, I opened MoviePass again, was [prompted again](https://i.imgur.com/FN7IlIl.jpg) and [uploaded another picture](https://i.imgur.com/z0VZKBI.jpg).

Almost immediately, I received [this email](https://i.imgur.com/h5QFAlB.jpg) saying my last check in failed the ticket verification process. The email specified a previous check-in from a movie I saw in April and the photo included in the email is from the 2nd time I was prompted for a ticket stub this morning.

Seems like the app may ask for older tickets now, and since the ticket verification prompt does not itself show the check-in information the user cannot know which ticket stub to provide.

I've already contacted support by phone, and sent a picture of both stubs through the in-app chat. Posting here as I haven't seen any other posts about the app prompting to verify anything older than the most recent check-in.

"Blah blah, first post, let’s get started.

As of right now, I’m still in shock to what happened earlier today at my job. I’ve been working at my current job as a server for almost a year and nothing, I mean absolutely nothing, has shocked me to what this 2 top said about our cooks. Usually, we have 4 cooks, but two of them are currently on vacation. At my restaurant, we have indoor and outdoor seating, and since today was a beautiful day, we were slammed all day long. 

This happened during the late morning breakfast rush.

As I was accommodating my tables I had at the time, this 2 top was seated at my section. I gave them a few minutes to look over the menu, and after I finished checking my other tables, I approached them and greeted them. Everything was going well, or so, I thought. They ordered drinks first, and I went to grab them their drinks. I return to their table with their beverages and they were ready to order. After they finished ordering their food, I told them, “Just to let you know, the cooks are very busy right now with the amount of orders coming from both indoors and outdoors. Once I place your order, your food will take at least 25-30 minutes to come out. Is that alright with you two?” They were disgruntled, but agreed. Three minutes go by and I finished placing their order, and I get signaled by the man of the 2 top. Since our restaurant is an open kitchen, you get the opportunity to see the cooks in action. The man takes a quick glance at the cooks and tell me “If our food doesn’t come out fast enough, I’m going to call immigration.” 

I. AM. SHOOK.
(By the way, our cooks are of Latino background and you can assume they are illegal. That is not the case.)

The man’s wife also nods in agreement. I give them a big malicious stare down, but not in single word I made. I left the scene visibly angry and went to check up on my other tables. Thirteen minutes go by and my manager is on the floor after finishing up his work. I asked to speak with him in private. Once he understood all the details, he didn’t hesitate. My manager went to the 2 top and called them out. This is how it went:

“Excuse me. I would like to let you know that I am the manager of this restaurant and I just got word from your server that you two made an offensive comment about our cooks. I do not tolerate unacceptable behavior, and your comment really offended our cooks that are preparing YOUR food. Our cooks are legal immigrants and dehumanizing them will not make you a better person. Even if they were illegal, immigrants come into this country to seek a better life for themselves or for his or her family. Immigrants come and do the jobs that majority of the American population won’t do, and yet, your petty comment shows how disrespectful you are to all walks of life. You are free to leave if you would like, and you won’t be charged for your drinks. But just remember, you live and pride yourself on stolen land.”

They got destroyed. After my manager left, they did not leave. The conversation they were once having was now null. They didn’t make a single word and stared at the table in shame. Their food came out ~10 minutes after their tear down, and I set their food on the table. They were given no service after that from me. They finish there food 12 minutes later and I give them their bill. 

The bill came out at $34.50. They left a $7 tip and I’m still surprised they even left a tip. They won’t be returning to the restaurant again, but I hope they learned a lesson not to dehumanize people based on where they come from. 

We live in the 21st century, and the ongoing controversy of illegal immigration still looms. Please, instead of threatening illegal immigrants of deportation, help them find a path towards citizenship. We need these people as they also contribute to our society. They are no less human.



TLDR; 2 top comes during hectic late morning breakfast rush. They see our cooks are Latinos and judge them as illegal immigrants. They threaten to call ICE if their food doesn’t come out in a timely manner. Manager utterly destroys them, leaving them speechless for the rest of their meal.",11,1528022913.0,8o5on9,False,"Blah blah, first post, let’s get started.

36 years old, 5'8"", 216lbs - 162lbs. I have never been in ""great"" shape (have always had a big butt and legs, some chub around the waist), but I was never as big as I had gotten in the last few years. I peaked at 216lbs and felt terrible all the time. I slept terribly, felt sick all the time, acid reflux, and just felt bad about myself. I ate bad things without thought and never worked out.

"Inspired by the story I just read from u/stupid_pun

So in the combatives level 1 qual course we're nearing the end and we have our own version of CPT TryHard (large, always trying to ensure everyone sees how good he is, etc.) among us the whole time.

He's been cocky the whole time sure but he's almost level 1 certified now! (lol)

This guy decides to challenge one of the instructors (FYI these dudes are like level 5 or some shit and about on par with amateur/semi pro MMA fighters at the very least)

Not just any instructor though...he picks what looks to be the scrawniest, dorkiest looking one of the bunch.  Glasses, weird overbite, maybe 5'6"" 130...kinda looks out of place as a combatives instructor but whatever.

CPT TryHard is a big dude.  At least 6'5"" and maybe like 230.  Not completely yolked but still a big dude.

The little instructor accepts the challenge without delay and also makes the wager:

""If you can get me to tap in 2 minutes, I'll sign your certificate and let you go...in fact if I don't get YOU to tap FIVE TIMES in 2 minutes I'll sign you off...how's that?""

WTF...This dude is stupid or a fucking bad ass....let's see this shit.

CPT TryHard obviously accepts the terms and we crowd around.

Little instructor takes his shirt off and he's fucking jacked.  He looks exactly like the UFC fighters you see on TV ...from the neck down.

Loud ""ohhhhhh shiiiitt"" and ""damnnn""s can be heard for miles


We were not expecting this lol

So they begin, CPT goes in for a clinch and the instructor does some sort of flip move and puts the CPT in a choke with his legs...while CPT is still standing. 

Tap 1: elapsed time, 5 seconds

CPT goes for a takedown, instructor sprawls, headlock, choke

Tap 2: another 5 seconds

CPT tries a clinch again, instructor sweeps his legs, gets on his back, rear naked choke 

Tap 3: maybe 3 seconds.

CPT tries to play it defensively this time and wait for instructor to make his move.  He does, clinch, trip, armbar...text book like on UFC.

Tap 4: about 12 seconds

CPT tries same tactic.  Instructor makes a yawning/looking at his watch motion mockingly and starts stretching.

Pissed CPT off and he goes with the takedown attempt again...but succeeds!  Uh oh! Weight alone ought to help win this for CPT!

Nope.

Instructor does some sorcery with his legs, the likes I've never seen, flips CPT off him somehow, rear naked choke...

Tap 5.

Total match ....less than a minute.

"From VCDL Alert:

The Virginia State Police are way, way behind on entering CHP holder information into the Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN).

What that means is that if you are stopped by law enforcement, who for some reason doesn't trust the validity of your CHP, and the officer queries VCIN, he might be told incorrectly that your permit doesn't exist (if new) or has expired!

Supposedly the VCIN system puts up a message warning officer's that it's data is not to be blindly trusted, but I'm hearing some officers are doing so anyway and there have been arrests.  If the VCIN information isn't 100% accurate, why are the State Police even providing it?  That's a recipe for disaster.

IF YOU HAVE BEEN **FALSELY** ARRESTED FOR AN INVALID OR EXPIRED CHP, OR KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS, VCDL NEEDS THE DETAILS!

We need to get to the bottom of this situation.  Like I said, publishing incorrect information on VCIN is worse than not publishing any information at all.

Please spread this message on any chat groups where Virginia gun owners are likely to see it.

They can contact ~~me~~, Philip Van Cleave, at president@vcdl.org.

"Just a quick post to get off my chest how much I loved this series, since no one I know has read them.

I read a lot as a kid but the habit fell off at uni as I had to read more and more for 'work' and just wanted to zone out on a night. I realised I didn't even know when the last time I finished a book was and after hearing about Red Rising on a podcast I decided to give it a go. I finished it faster than I've finished any book and the rest of the trilogy within the next month or two and loved every page.

The writing in the first one isn't the best, but the pacing is so snappy that I stopped noticing it. The characters and their arcs are masterfully constructed. I was moved to tears at least once or twice per book. People may have seen the twists coming a mile off but for the most part I didn't, I was too gripped and excited to try to read between the lines. 

As the series continues it only gets better - the scope of the universe widens as more of its history, people, places, technology, myths and feuds are detailed. Despite how macho the story is at its core, no characters feel shallow or rigid or perfect - everyone is given a fair, respectful treatment based on their character and merits, never for the titillation of the reader.

I urge anyone who wants to get back into reading to try Red Rising, especially if you have any love for sci-fi, dystopian fiction or even military history. For everyone here, they're so easy to read you could easily blast through them on your holiday this summer so give it a go and let me know what you think!

"Posting this because it helps me stay accountable...

Typical Saturday: Go to grocery store (shopping with a hangover sucks), come home, make some breakfast. Scrambled eggs and bacon sounds good so let's wash it down with a gin and OJ. Crossword puzzle in the newspaper is hard today....maybe it'll be easier if I relax with another cocktail. Time to vacuum. Blech! That's more fun with a refreshing screwdriver. Now I'll relax and read a book...with just a small cocktail since I know I've already had a couple and I'm such a responsible drinker. Almost time for dinner so I'll take a shower...but my hand is empty and since I don't need all that sugar from OJ I'll have a healthier vodka rocks with lemon wedge. I'm in charge of the salad while he's outside grilling so just another nip before dinner. Totally reasonable to split a bottle of wine with our steaks right? And who wouldn't love a glass of port or two with the chocolate dessert? Now its 2am, I am awake, feel like shit, can't even remember what the hell we screamed at each other about and there is not enough h2o on the planet to quench my dehydration. 

Reading this truth is so gross. So today I will probably do all those things (except the screaming match 😉) without all the booze...accomplish a lot...have a nice day....enjoy a damn delicious dinner... and not waste my Sunday with a hangover.

"This album is about the English Countryside. It has strong Victorian, 40s, 50s and late 80s/early 90s Victoriana influences. It's a tribute to my mom, who subscribed to Victoria magazine and *loved* the Victorian ""renaissance"" in the late 80s and early 90s. 

Colors are muted, heathered blues, greens, pinks, browns, creams. Tones are soft, creamy versions of colors. 

Fabrics are natural: tweeds, linens, cottons, wools, leather, silks. Style is refined maximalism: textures on textures, scarves on everything, subdued print mixing. Romance and traditional ""English Rose"" hyper feminine looks play with schoolboy cute for a look I call 'schoolboygirl'. 

Clothing is functional with a playful wink of whimsy. 

Hair is natural, shining, tousled, and abundant--preferably blown by the wind in the top-down drive to the countryside. 

Love for history, heritage and heirlooms is evident, especially in accessories: signet rings, hand me down scarves, Grandmother's brooches.

This look is interesting in that almost all the pieces could be worn by children or adults in theory, but it's not ""childish"" or infantilizing. 

It's never dramatic, industrial (this is not Steampunk), or avant garde. One looks as if one has stepped out of a late 80s Ralph Lauren ad at all times. :)

Patron Saint(s): Kiera Knightly in Atonement, Any single cast member of a Merchant Ivory production circa 1990. 

I tried to show different interpretations of this very classic and timeless look: more boyish/androgynous, modern updates, and so on.

I actually think this might be the second in a series of inspo albums: alluring women's fashion that is not ""sexy"", because I find these styles lovely and very appealing, without being conventionally ""sexy"".

"*Amateurs study tactics, professionals study logistics*

- Abraham Einstein the Great

(I always thought the above quote was random internet garbage, but even [West Point](http://americanhistory.si.edu/westpoint/history_5b.html) acknowledges it)

Humanoids shooting each other with bullets and missiles on the surface of planets is pretty easy to fathom, which is probably why we see so much more of it than other kinds of combat in 40k.

But, in 40k as in the real world, it is often a wholly different arena of war that proves most decisive: naval combat.

In the real world (or, if you will, in the period M-2 to M3), naval (sea-borne) warfare has often proven to be the chief determinant of military success for an empire. That is because the sea has nearly always allowed for faster transport of large quantities of goods and soldiers, which is essential to getting the resources you need where you need them in time. With the introduction of very long range weapons, naval supremacy also allowed to bring vast firepower to bear upon land targets.

Much the same is true in 40k. Transport of goods and men is essentially to the war effort of spacefaring civilizations, and control of space allows for orbital combartment and orbital drops against planetbound targets.

In this post, I want to go over the main elements of naval warfare in 40k, and why its realities produce the kind of tactics that we see, which sometimes appear contrieved. I will especially concentrate on the logistics of void warfare since, much as with earlier forms of war, they hugely constrain what is possible and especially what is sensible. I will concentrate on Imperial technology and tactics, as other races use such radically different forms of travel as to impel entirely different considerations.

I will proceed from the large scale to the small scale, thus starting with:

---

#**Warp travel**

While Imperial plasma engines can accelerate a ship to high fractions of lightspeed, more than sufficient for in-system transit, moving *between* systems with any real speed requires FTL travel, the only reliable form of which is Warp travel.

Warp travel is messy. A ship must physically enter the nightmare dimension of the Othersea, and its Navigator must steer it through currents and storms of pure psychic energy towards its destination.

At the short scale, this is relatively easy. If your Gellar field (the shield that protects the physical existence of the ship from the dematerializing influence of the Warp) holds, if there aren't extreme Warp phenomena at your current location, the Navigator can mostly handle the ship on his own.

But, as we all know, at large distances this becomes impossible, because the sequence of Warp currents, storms, eddies etc becomes impossible to navigate without a reference point. Fortunately, the Emperor provides just such a reference point: the Astronomican, which shines all over the Imperium (in fact, the limits of the Astronomican's reach mark the end of Imperial sovereignty), shows Navigators a fixed point against which they can compare their positions and correct their course during long-distance travel.

But matters are not so simple. Even with the Astronomican, the Warp remains a quintessentially chaotic environment. Assuming no extreme phenomena, a Navigator will always eventually bring a ship to its destination, but the *speed* and *reliability* with which this can be accomplished are far from guaranteed.

To guarantee speed and consistency of travel, it is very strongly preferred to travel the Warp through those areas which are reliably calm, or in which Warp phenomena are at least so predictable that they can be accounted for.

When these areas of predictable travel connect points of interests (like star systems), they are called **Warp routes** or **Warp conduits**. Places where Warp conduits cross are natural strategic locations, much like the intersection of major roads is in our time. Controlling such a system allows one's forces to quickly travel to connected systems, and most importantly to maintain supply lanes to connected frontlines.

We have reached the first fundamental element of void warfare logististics: **control of Warp routes and, especially, of systems where Warp routes cross provides a fundamental strategic advantage**.

---

#**System travel**

Ok, so now we know about travelling in between systems. What about travel *within* systems?

The first fixed point about in-system travel is that Warp capable vessels can not translate to and from the Immaterium wherever they want. The **Mandeville points** are locations, virtually always at the edge of a star system, where entering and exiting the Warp is possible with a high degree of safety. Translation *can* be achieved elsewhere, but not as reliably and not as safely.

So, in terms of military operations, control of the Mandeville point is essential. A force that wants to break into a system must first establish a spearhead at the Mandeville point.

Once we are at the Mandeville point, what else? we'll usually want to reach places of interest inside the system, like inhabited planets, space docks, mines, star forts and so on. Virtually all of these will be located within the system's rotation plane. Why?

The natural objects in a star system tend to rotate inside a very narrow plane, a result of conservation of angular momentum during the formation of the system's celestial bodies. Planet-bound manmade structures, like hive cities, forges and orbital spacesports thus naturally exist on the orbital plane. Structures like space stations could theoretically be built in a different orbit, but that would make reaching them very inconvenient, and there's basically nothing of interest outside the orbital plane, so it is rarely done.

Thus, the quickest way to travel from the Mandeville point to virtually all locations of interest in a star system is to travel within the orbital plane. This naturally defines a preferred plane of movement for military operations, because movements outside the orbital plane take much longer and is subject to interception by adversaries located within the orbital plane, since you have to go above (or below) them.

This is the actual answer to the perennial question: why does anyone bother fighting their way from the Mandeville point to the inside of a star system, when they could just fly around the orbital plane?

The answer is that such a tactic would be very risky. While space is *very* empty and *very* large and physical scans struggle to pick up even kilometer-long objects unless they know where to look, psychic augurs are far less limited in this sense, and a sizeable military fleet runs a very serious risk of discovery if attempting such a maneuver.

Once discovered, adversaries can strike against the outflanking force by flying up (or down) form the orbital plane, and so do any reinforcements that might be summoned. On the other hand, if the outflanking force wants to reach its own lines (say, back at the Mandeville point), it has a far longer way to go, and so do any reinforcements it might need.

Thus, without extreme differences in speed, the force entrenched in the orbital plane, since it needs to travel a much shorter distance, can decide the time and place of engagement, and much more readily withdraw or receive reinforcements, granting it a large tactical advantage.

Only stealth specialists, like the Night Lords, stand a chance of meaningfully adopting such tactics, and even they can usually only do it with a few ships at a time.

Which brings us to the second element of void strategy: **it is near-mandatory, when assaulting a star system, to fight your way in from the Mandeville point, through the various defense strongpoints located in the orbital plane, finally reaching your target location**. Trying to fly over or under enemy strongpoints exposes the outflanking force to risks that are not sustainable without an extreme superiority in power (and, in that case, one might as well destroy or capture the strongpoints anyway).

---

#**Naval combat**

So, we've seen how the realities of Warp travel and star system dyanmics make certain systems strategic, and demand a certain kind of appraoch when trying to conquer a system from the outside.

So, what about actually fighting other people in space?

The first thing to consider is that space is *very* large compared to both a voidship's size and the distances it and its weapons can cover within a useful timeframe. Sublight attacks can easily take minutes to reach voidships that are not farther away than a planet and its moon, a tiny distance compared to even that between a planet and the closest other planet.

Between scans and augurs, attacks happening at such distances are essentially trivial to avoid, by steering the ship away from their projected course.

This mandates that ships wanting to destroy one another must get within useful firing distance. Because of the considerations from the previous point, the virtual totality of space battles are fought inside the orbital plane. And because many systems of interests are fortified with orbiting and planet-bound defenses, defending fleets hug close to them, and thus attacking fleets must come into planetary orbit to give battle, resulting in many if not most real space battles being fought in planetary orbit. Fights that don't happen in orbit are most often the result of ambushes or chases of fleeing ships.

Once within range, ships have a compelling incentive to bring as many destructive weapons to bear against the enemy as possible while offering the smallest and most armored surface possible to counter-fire. This essentially need, common to basically all spacefaring fleets, coupled with each race's technological abilities, has driven the design of military voidships towards the signature shapes employed by each race.

Human military voidcraft has followed design principles of very ancient heritage: it offers an armored point towards the enemy, which presents a narrow and heavily protected attack surface, enabling ships to approach one another in relative safety. Weapons are clustered along the sides of the ship, which have ample space to house the gargantuan machinery and their equally titanic munitions stores and generators; the armored prow itself can only house many fewer weapons by comparison. 

The rear of the ship, where the main manevuering thrusters and thermal exhausts are located, can neither be heavily armored nor armed, presenting a natural weak point. In addition, a shot fired perpendicular to the ship only has so much of the vessel to damage and will, if it fully penetrates, simply exit from the other side; a shot that should enter the ship from the stern (rear) could wreak havok along a much longer path.

Thus, basic naval tactics revolve around bringing as many guns to bear on the enemy weak points as possible, while exposing as small and as armored an attack surface to the enemy as possible. The ideal situation is to be able to deliver raking fire, in which a ship unleashes a full broadside into the stern of the enemy, devastating it while minimally exposing itself.

The dance of ships trying to outmaneuver each other in this manner often proves indecisive, as it's a huge gamble for one to move forward and try to reach engagement range. To break the stall, two other main tactics are used: ramming and boarding.

In ramming, the heavily armored prow is driven directly at the enemy ship. If done at speed and with an advantageous angle of attack, this tactic  can cause extreme damage to the enemy while minimizing exposure to enemy fire, since the heavily armored prow is the most exposed portion of the ramming ship.

In boarding, fast attack torpedoes lodge into the superstructure of an enemy ship, delivering soldiers into its bowels. Boarding brings the fight from the realm of extreme long distance fire to that of infantry combat, which is far more decisive (whether the attackers or the defenders win).

Due to the way Imperial ships are built, the three-dimensional nature of space is compressed into a narrow battle disc (or several): ships attempting to attack from a high angle would be intercepted by other ships matching said angle, and such a flanking tactic rarely serves more than to break off the fight in separate components to no clear advantage. It is thus rarely attempted, and commanders prefer to keep their fleets together, presenting a single front to the enemy, with the ability for groups of ships to quickly support one another, concentrate fire etc. (exceptions, as usual, are ambushes and other surprise attacks, or attacks relying on numerical superiority).

Thus we come to the conclusion of this longest section: **Imperial naval tactics inevitably favor engaging within a near-2D battlespace, maintaining fleet cohesion, and maneuvering to gain the best firing position once the ships come within firing range**. Thus the typical course of a 40k Imperial naval battle is deduced as a result of the technical realities of navigation and combat.

---

#**Conclusion**

The main reason why I wrote this post was that I had always been irked by that classic of space-fiction pet-peeves: why the hell are battles always portrayed as almost seaborne naval fights, with ordered ranks of ships coming at each other head on over a common plane of flight? why don't people fly over and around their enemies, both in the strategic and in the tactical arena? and, if space travel can take us anywhere, why are we always doing stuff, especially naval stuff, inside star systems?

I think 40k provides all the elements to sensibly justify its depiction of *human* space combat. I've been thinking about it for a while, posting bits and pieces of these various reasonings here and there, so I've wanted to gather them all in one spot and run down a nice overview of the phenomenon.",22,1527998794.0,8o37nk,False,"*Amateurs study tactics, professionals study logistics*

In boarding, fast attack torpedoes lodge into the superstructure of an enemy ship, delivering soldiers into its bowels. Boarding brings the fight from the realm of extreme long distance fire to that of infantry combat, which is far more decisive (whether the attackers or the defenders win).

Due to the way Imperial ships are built, the three-dimensional nature of space is compressed into a narrow battle disc (or several): ships attempting to attack from a high angle would be intercepted by other ships matching said angle, and such a flanking tactic rarely serves more than to break off the fight in separate components to no clear advantage. It is thus rarely attempted, and commanders prefer to keep their fleets together, presenting a single front to the enemy, with the ability for groups of ships to quickly support one another, concentrate fire etc. (exceptions, as usual, are ambushes and other surprise attacks, or attacks relying on numerical superiority).

Thus we come to the conclusion of this longest section: **Imperial naval tactics inevitably favor engaging within a near-2D battlespace, maintaining fleet cohesion, and maneuvering to gain the best firing position once the ships come within firing range**. Thus the typical course of a 40k Imperial naval battle is deduced as a result of the technical realities of navigation and combat.

#**Conclusion**

The main reason why I wrote this post was that I had always been irked by that classic of space-fiction pet-peeves: why the hell are battles always portrayed as almost seaborne naval fights, with ordered ranks of ships coming at each other head on over a common plane of flight? why don't people fly over and around their enemies, both in the strategic and in the tactical arena? and, if space travel can take us anywhere, why are we always doing stuff, especially naval stuff, inside star systems?

I think 40k provides all the elements to sensibly justify its depiction of *human* space combat. I've been thinking about it for a while, posting bits and pieces of these various reasonings here and there, so I've wanted to gather them all in one spot and run down a nice overview of the phenomenon.",0,"*Amateurs study tactics, professionals study logistics*

- Abraham Einstein the Great

(I always thought the above quote was random internet garbage, but even [West Point](http://americanhistory.si.edu/westpoint/history_5b.html) acknowledges it)

Humanoids shooting each other with bullets and missiles on the surface of planets is pretty easy to fathom, which is probably why we see so much more of it than other kinds of combat in 40k.

But, in 40k as in the real world, it is often a wholly different arena of war that proves most decisive: naval combat.

In the real world (or, if you will, in the period M-2 to M3), naval (sea-borne) warfare has often proven to be the chief determinant of military success for an empire. That is because the sea has nearly always allowed for faster transport of large quantities of goods and soldiers, which is essential to getting the resources you need where you need them in time. With the introduction of very long range weapons, naval supremacy also allowed to bring vast firepower to bear upon land targets.

Much the same is true in 40k. Transport of goods and men is essentially to the war effort of spacefaring civilizations, and control of space allows for orbital combartment and orbital drops against planetbound targets.

In this post, I want to go over the main elements of naval warfare in 40k, and why its realities produce the kind of tactics that we see, which sometimes appear contrieved. I will especially concentrate on the logistics of void warfare since, much as with earlier forms of war, they hugely constrain what is possible and especially what is sensible. I will concentrate on Imperial technology and tactics, as other races use such radically different forms of travel as to impel entirely different considerations.

I will proceed from the large scale to the small scale, thus starting with:

---

#**Warp travel**

While Imperial plasma engines can accelerate a ship to high fractions of lightspeed, more than sufficient for in-system transit, moving *between* systems with any real speed requires FTL travel, the only reliable form of which is Warp travel.

Warp travel is messy. A ship must physically enter the nightmare dimension of the Othersea, and its Navigator must steer it through currents and storms of pure psychic energy towards its destination.

At the short scale, this is relatively easy. If your Gellar field (the shield that protects the physical existence of the ship from the dematerializing influence of the Warp) holds, if there aren't extreme Warp phenomena at your current location, the Navigator can mostly handle the ship on his own.

But, as we all know, at large distances this becomes impossible, because the sequence of Warp currents, storms, eddies etc becomes impossible to navigate without a reference point. Fortunately, the Emperor provides just such a reference point: the Astronomican, which shines all over the Imperium (in fact, the limits of the Astronomican's reach mark the end of Imperial sovereignty), shows Navigators a fixed point against which they can compare their positions and correct their course during long-distance travel.

But matters are not so simple. Even with the Astronomican, the Warp remains a quintessentially chaotic environment. Assuming no extreme phenomena, a Navigator will always eventually bring a ship to its destination, but the *speed* and *reliability* with which this can be accomplished are far from guaranteed.

To guarantee speed and consistency of travel, it is very strongly preferred to travel the Warp through those areas which are reliably calm, or in which Warp phenomena are at least so predictable that they can be accounted for.

When these areas of predictable travel connect points of interests (like star systems), they are called **Warp routes** or **Warp conduits**. Places where Warp conduits cross are natural strategic locations, much like the intersection of major roads is in our time. Controlling such a system allows one's forces to quickly travel to connected systems, and most importantly to maintain supply lanes to connected frontlines.

We have reached the first fundamental element of void warfare logististics: **control of Warp routes and, especially, of systems where Warp routes cross provides a fundamental strategic advantage**.

---

#**System travel**

Ok, so now we know about travelling in between systems. What about travel *within* systems?

The first fixed point about in-system travel is that Warp capable vessels can not translate to and from the Immaterium wherever they want. The **Mandeville points** are locations, virtually always at the edge of a star system, where entering and exiting the Warp is possible with a high degree of safety. Translation *can* be achieved elsewhere, but not as reliably and not as safely.

So, in terms of military operations, control of the Mandeville point is essential. A force that wants to break into a system must first establish a spearhead at the Mandeville point.

Once we are at the Mandeville point, what else? we'll usually want to reach places of interest inside the system, like inhabited planets, space docks, mines, star forts and so on. Virtually all of these will be located within the system's rotation plane. Why?

The natural objects in a star system tend to rotate inside a very narrow plane, a result of conservation of angular momentum during the formation of the system's celestial bodies. Planet-bound manmade structures, like hive cities, forges and orbital spacesports thus naturally exist on the orbital plane. Structures like space stations could theoretically be built in a different orbit, but that would make reaching them very inconvenient, and there's basically nothing of interest outside the orbital plane, so it is rarely done.

Thus, the quickest way to travel from the Mandeville point to virtually all locations of interest in a star system is to travel within the orbital plane. This naturally defines a preferred plane of movement for military operations, because movements outside the orbital plane take much longer and is subject to interception by adversaries located within the orbital plane, since you have to go above (or below) them.

This is the actual answer to the perennial question: why does anyone bother fighting their way from the Mandeville point to the inside of a star system, when they could just fly around the orbital plane?

The answer is that such a tactic would be very risky. While space is *very* empty and *very* large and physical scans struggle to pick up even kilometer-long objects unless they know where to look, psychic augurs are far less limited in this sense, and a sizeable military fleet runs a very serious risk of discovery if attempting such a maneuver.

Once discovered, adversaries can strike against the outflanking force by flying up (or down) form the orbital plane, and so do any reinforcements that might be summoned. On the other hand, if the outflanking force wants to reach its own lines (say, back at the Mandeville point), it has a far longer way to go, and so do any reinforcements it might need.

Thus, without extreme differences in speed, the force entrenched in the orbital plane, since it needs to travel a much shorter distance, can decide the time and place of engagement, and much more readily withdraw or receive reinforcements, granting it a large tactical advantage.

Only stealth specialists, like the Night Lords, stand a chance of meaningfully adopting such tactics, and even they can usually only do it with a few ships at a time.

Which brings us to the second element of void strategy: **it is near-mandatory, when assaulting a star system, to fight your way in from the Mandeville point, through the various defense strongpoints located in the orbital plane, finally reaching your target location**. Trying to fly over or under enemy strongpoints exposes the outflanking force to risks that are not sustainable without an extreme superiority in power (and, in that case, one might as well destroy or capture the strongpoints anyway).

---

#**Naval combat**

So, we've seen how the realities of Warp travel and star system dyanmics make certain systems strategic, and demand a certain kind of appraoch when trying to conquer a system from the outside.

So, what about actually fighting other people in space?

The first thing to consider is that space is *very* large compared to both a voidship's size and the distances it and its weapons can cover within a useful timeframe. Sublight attacks can easily take minutes to reach voidships that are not farther away than a planet and its moon, a tiny distance compared to even that between a planet and the closest other planet.

Between scans and augurs, attacks happening at such distances are essentially trivial to avoid, by steering the ship away from their projected course.

This mandates that ships wanting to destroy one another must get within useful firing distance. Because of the considerations from the previous point, the virtual totality of space battles are fought inside the orbital plane. And because many systems of interests are fortified with orbiting and planet-bound defenses, defending fleets hug close to them, and thus attacking fleets must come into planetary orbit to give battle, resulting in many if not most real space battles being fought in planetary orbit. Fights that don't happen in orbit are most often the result of ambushes or chases of fleeing ships.

Once within range, ships have a compelling incentive to bring as many destructive weapons to bear against the enemy as possible while offering the smallest and most armored surface possible to counter-fire. This essentially need, common to basically all spacefaring fleets, coupled with each race's technological abilities, has driven the design of military voidships towards the signature shapes employed by each race.

Human military voidcraft has followed design principles of very ancient heritage: it offers an armored point towards the enemy, which presents a narrow and heavily protected attack surface, enabling ships to approach one another in relative safety. Weapons are clustered along the sides of the ship, which have ample space to house the gargantuan machinery and their equally titanic munitions stores and generators; the armored prow itself can only house many fewer weapons by comparison. 

The rear of the ship, where the main manevuering thrusters and thermal exhausts are located, can neither be heavily armored nor armed, presenting a natural weak point. In addition, a shot fired perpendicular to the ship only has so much of the vessel to damage and will, if it fully penetrates, simply exit from the other side; a shot that should enter the ship from the stern (rear) could wreak havok along a much longer path.

Thus, basic naval tactics revolve around bringing as many guns to bear on the enemy weak points as possible, while exposing as small and as armored an attack surface to the enemy as possible. The ideal situation is to be able to deliver raking fire, in which a ship unleashes a full broadside into the stern of the enemy, devastating it while minimally exposing itself.

The dance of ships trying to outmaneuver each other in this manner often proves indecisive, as it's a huge gamble for one to move forward and try to reach engagement range. To break the stall, two other main tactics are used: ramming and boarding.

In ramming, the heavily armored prow is driven directly at the enemy ship. If done at speed and with an advantageous angle of attack, this tactic  can cause extreme damage to the enemy while minimizing exposure to enemy fire, since the heavily armored prow is the most exposed portion of the ramming ship.

In boarding, fast attack torpedoes lodge into the superstructure of an enemy ship, delivering soldiers into its bowels. Boarding brings the fight from the realm of extreme long distance fire to that of infantry combat, which is far more decisive (whether the attackers or the defenders win).

Due to the way Imperial ships are built, the three-dimensional nature of space is compressed into a narrow battle disc (or several): ships attempting to attack from a high angle would be intercepted by other ships matching said angle, and such a flanking tactic rarely serves more than to break off the fight in separate components to no clear advantage. It is thus rarely attempted, and commanders prefer to keep their fleets together, presenting a single front to the enemy, with the ability for groups of ships to quickly support one another, concentrate fire etc. (exceptions, as usual, are ambushes and other surprise attacks, or attacks relying on numerical superiority).

Thus we come to the conclusion of this longest section: **Imperial naval tactics inevitably favor engaging within a near-2D battlespace, maintaining fleet cohesion, and maneuvering to gain the best firing position once the ships come within firing range**. Thus the typical course of a 40k Imperial naval battle is deduced as a result of the technical realities of navigation and combat.

"The other day at work, we got a script in for an augmentin suspension. I fill it as normal and we toss it into the bin to be picked up. The patient arrives to pick it up and I notice the cost is covered by insurance so I go ahead and have the pharmacist mix it. 

The patient was a child, so their mother was asking questions about the medication. I meant to tell her she was picking up augmentin (I usually use name brands because most people know them better) but I accidentally started off saying amoxicillin. Well, thank god I did because she immediately started questioning if there really was amoxicillin in this medication. Of course there is and I told her exactly that. Turns out, the patient has a penicillin allergy. I immediately inform my pharmacist and make sure the suspension goes nowhere near them.

Our next course of action was to find out if the doctor knew about this allergy. Apparently the doctor DID know and had initially prescribed just a plain old amoxicillin suspension but had cancelled the script upon finding out. Somehow this doctor thought that augmentin had no amoxicillin in it and would be fine for the patient. We couldn’t believe the level of stupidity from the doctor.

2017: started taking 3-month long breaks but still had quality content (clown stream) 

summer 2017: came back to twitch and began variety streams, poggers, Pog for the non normies

fall/early winter 2017: says he uninstalled league and is done

second day: 150k viewers poggers

first week: still around 80k viewers nice

second week: 30k viewers, getting kind of boring, hardstuck plat

third week: 25k viewers, tyler has regressed to talking once every 2 minutes

"Let me begin by saying that when we split into our groups for the racial bias training last Tuesday, I was put with my manager (who is white) and two of my coworkers (who are also white). I was the only Asian guy at my group. I think that the racial bias training did nothing but emphasize the racial divisions between us; all of us were uncomfortably aware that I was the only person of color at our group. During the activity in which we tried to name all the differences between ourselves, it became immediately apparent that the major divide between myself and the others in my group was my racial identity, whereas before the training I'd never really thought about it before. Now, after the training, I am very aware of the fact that I am one of the few people of color working at my store. It's made work a lot more uncomfortable for me personally because the training felt designed to point out our differences instead of emphasizing shared commonalities. I feel like I have less in common with my white coworkers than I do with my minority coworkers, which defeats the whole purpose of racial bias training. If I feel more comfortable with people who look like me than people who don't, that IS racial bias, and the training seemed to exacerbate that IMO.

To me personally, it was laughable how blatant of a PR move the training was. It didn't really do anything except make us have awkward conversations in which no one said anything meaningful and afterwards tell us to be ""color brave"", whatever that means. I understand that African-Americans in this country face many valid struggles, and I'm not disputing that; however, I have a hard time calling it ""diversity training"" or ""racial bias training"" because it only focused on the biases towards a single demographic. Honestly, it disgusted me a little how bad it was. There was a ten-minute Jim Crow segregation recap that nobody needed, and hours of pointless activities that did nothing to combat racial bias. If anything, the training made us anxious about our racial identities and the possibility of being viewed as racially biased, and worsened race relations among partners. 

As a whole, I was wholly dissatisfied with the training. I endure a lot of racially biased crap at my store (e.g. ""Where are you from? No, I mean where are you *really* from?"") from both customers and coworkers alike, and I'm pissed that we didn't talk about anything except black vs. white at all. I've seen my coworkers grossly mishandle situations involving Hispanic people as well as Asian people and it pisses me off that the training didn't even attempt to address those sorts of behaviors. I don't even want to say anything about this to my coworkers because as soon as I do, I'm just the Asian guy who's angry that Asian people weren't a part of the diversity training. This whole situation is fucking stupid and it disgusts me how manufactured the whole thing was. I can definitively say that I am a lot less proud to wear my green apron now than I was before the training.

I guess I just felt like the training marginalized everyone who wasn't African-American, and glossed over the experiences of so many other Americans, and that's why I'm angry about it.

"Get a job at a **busy** gas station that sells cigarettes.


Keep track of the single packs you sell, but do not ring them up (customers never want a receipt, anyway); use the ""no sale"" button so the register makes all of the appropriate beeping noises.


After ten packs, ring them up as a carton, which is considerably cheaper (depending on state laws) and keep the difference, (which is around $7-$10 or more, depending on brand.  Use a coupon for even more profit.


I paid for ALL of my college plus much, much more with this technique.  I would ring about four or five cartons (instead of 40-50 single packs) every shift and almost always had a coupon for a those cartons (usually a $4 coupon); it would yield $50-$70 per *shift*- all cash.  I worked five days every week (and certainly picked up a sixth if someone needed the day off), and made around $300 per week/$1200 cash per month.  Add that tax free cash to your hourly wage and it adds up FAST.  My station was near a major college and just off of I-95 (you can probably guess where within a few cities).  My daily shift sold around 200-250 packs of cigarettes and sometimes, a lot more.  That sounds like a lot, but it's not.  Ask anyone that works at a very busy gas station.  Plenty of customers ask for, ""two packs of or three packs of...""  The quantity adds up faster than you would believe.  Tobacco is a multi-billion dollar industry for a reason.


This worked because we didn't track cigarettes by brand, just by  type: regular (like Marlboros/Newports), generic (Vantage, etc), and sub generic (Basics/Highway).  The inventory was never off, which is important because we had to manually count cigarettes after every shift and your relief also had to count them to verify your count.  They were tightly controlled.

The second year of using this technique, we started selling Black & Mild singles for $1.50.  OMFG, my profits soared.  I would buy a brick and basically sell them from my own stock.  It almost doubled my profit.  This was even easier than the cigarette technique, because I didn't have to keep track the different brand prices.


Needless to say, I worked at that gas station for three years.  


If anyone wants to try this, be aware of many factors.  I was on camera at ALL TIMES (as you will most likely be), so it's challenging to make all of this look normal, especially while tracking the individual pack sales.  Over the years, I developed countless pro tips for dealing with suspicious customers, unnatural carton sales compared to other shifts/stores, TAX stamps, and dealing with co-workers (we always had two to three employees working during my shift, due to volume).  


Good luck, ULPTers!

"I was checking the legends of my world when I came across this astouding story of an elven civilization. I saw the entire history from the perspective of 1 elf, so it goes like this:

    The civ was attacked many many times and they lost all of their sites to the goblins and this elf fought in 1 of them, among with his family. During one battle he was imprisioned and stayed a prisioner for 80 years. This was enough for the rest of the civ to be wipped out completely. And here's the good part: the elf was only released bc the  goblin site he was in was destroyed by a roc.

So to finish I told that they lost all of their sites. Guess wich one the elf choose to settle in? Yep. He took over the goblin site for himself after the beast left, bc everyone died.

• 6.30pm arrives and one solitary dude arrives, tells us he's early for the ""7 o'clock booking for 12 people"". My heart starts to sink.

• Also 7.10pm. The original booker tells me she told everyone the reservation was for 7pm ""because that time worked best for me and I didn't want to come at 6pm"" fuck you lady

• 7.34pm I'm starting the feel the burn. It's still only 7 people. Mister number 8 can fuck off if he ever decides to arrive. I asked about dietery requirements and was assured all was good.

They throw a huge shit fit when they realise we gave the extra seats away because they were no shows.  They leave threatening bad reviews and the original 7 give us the stink eye

• 9pm. Secret weapon time. My boss knows I'm a twat. He let's me loose on rude tables. I have his full approval. Because we're a small restaurant (seats around 40) we have a service charge on tables of 8 or more. I slap it on their bill because fuck them. They immediately argue a 20$ charge on a +500$ bill.

• 9.12pm they leave - service charge paid. They threatened to complain and I gave them a business card and asked them to spell our name right online. It was a super hollow victory but it was worth it.",0,"Still real mad so I'm gonna break this shut down in bullet points so I don't go on an epic rant:

• 12 top tried to book for 7pm Saturday, accepted 6pm instead to accommodate other bookings

• Called them 3 times and left a voicemail to confirm booking and numbers, they never picked up

• 6pm Saturday rolls around, still no confirmation and no one is here. The happy birthday balloons they asked for are looking lonely.

• 6.30pm arrives and one solitary dude arrives, tells us he's early for the ""7 o'clock booking for 12 people"". My heart starts to sink.

• 7.10pm arrives and there are 7 people at the table of 12 - except it's not longer a table of 12 it's 8 but they were waiting for *us* to call *them* so they could tell us that. I confirm their mobile number and ask why they didn't pick up. ""Oh I don't answer numbers I don't recognise"" bitch what the fuck now

• Also 7.10pm. The original booker tells me she told everyone the reservation was for 7pm ""because that time worked best for me and I didn't want to come at 6pm"" fuck you lady

• 7.34pm I'm starting the feel the burn. It's still only 7 people. Mister number 8 can fuck off if he ever decides to arrive. I asked about dietery requirements and was assured all was good. Cue a massive fit from 2 women who are apparently pregnant and didn't know that cured meat is not the same as cooked meat. *bitch I asked you*

• 8pm - a full two hours after the original booking and an hour after their imaginary booking, 3 more people turn up. They want to eat. They want to sit down. They throw a huge shit fit when they realise we gave the extra seats away because they were no shows.  They leave threatening bad reviews and the original 7 give us the stink eye

• 9pm. Secret weapon time. My boss knows I'm a twat. He let's me loose on rude tables. I have his full approval. Because we're a small restaurant (seats around 40) we have a service charge on tables of 8 or more. I slap it on their bill because fuck them. They immediately argue a 20$ charge on a +500$ bill. I tell them tough shit because they booked for 12 and if they'd bothered to pick up the phone, answer the phone or even turn up on time we'd have been able to amend their booking. Service charge non refundable. Pay the fuck up.

"Hey everybody. My name is Gordon. I own a small comic shop in Baltimore, Maryland called Universal Comics. I'm going to post a little inside baseball here. It may be less than professional, but I do believe it is warranted because the actions of Diamond Comic Distributors are FAR less than professional.

This week, Universal Comics received 0 copies of Amazing Spider-Man 800, 0 copies of Punisher 225, 0 copies of Daredevil 603, 0 copies of Star Wars Lando Double or Nothing, 0 copies of Amazing Spider-Man Renew Your Vows, only 2 copies of You Are Deadpool 5, and faced serious shortages on multiple other titles I can't even think of off the top of my head here.. despite having submitted our order over 2 months ago on time, well before the Final Order Cutoff. Many other retailers in the area received hundreds, in some cases thousands, of copies of the aforementioned titles.

Diamond knew exactly how many copies to order from Marvel 2 months ago, and they knew exactly how many copies I ordered before the deadline. Every retailer is contractually obligated to pay in full at the time of pickup, regardless of any extenuating circumstances, which is an obligation Universal Comics has never failed to meet in all the time Diamond Comic Distributors has existed. Diamond has zero risk in all this.

Marvel knew exactly how many copies to print of these books, as they were told how many were needed by Diamond Comic Distributors over 2 months ago. Marvel has zero risk in all this.

Universal Comics (and every other comic book specialty shop) has to float 100% of the risk for these two multimillion/billion dollar companies, as we are the only (and dramatically smallest) link in the chain that is contractually obligated to pay for these books, no matter what happens.

Diamond failed to deliver on their end of the bargain. Many of our customers have chosen to go to other shops to pick up the books that Diamond failed to deliver to us in a timely manner. These are very expensive comics, Amazing Spider-Man 800 has a $9.99 cover price. And we are still obligated to pay in full for these books, regardless of the fact that many of my customers already got copies elsewhere.

So, Universal Comics has lost out on the sale of all these books, will likely lose subscribers over this, which will dramatically hurt our business, but Diamond and Marvel will still get paid because they have an army of lawyers that can and will crush us if we dispute their unprofessional and contract-breaching failure to deliver. And NONE of this is our fault.

Diamond Comic Distributors has a monopoly on the comic book business, and as such they simply DO NOT CARE how they treat their customers (us, the Local Comic Shops). And we, as retailers, have literally no alternative because Diamond has 100% control over comic book distribution.

Universal Comics has been in business for YEARS longer than Diamond, but is treated like we don't matter, because they have zero incentive to care what happens to us (or any other independent retailer).

I'd like to add here that I'm not being unreasonable in all this. If it were one or maybe two titles we got shorted on, it happens. No one is perfect. But this is becoming a persistent problem. Last week we received 0 copies of invincible Iron Man 600 and 0 copies of Old Man Logan 40. Which has dramatically effected our sales on these titles, as customers went elsewhere to get them. 2 weeks in a row, shorted on some of the year's biggest books, sales tanked as a result, and now many of our subscribers are angry with us and considering leaving. All thanks to Diamond Comic Distributors' failure to fulfill their obligations.

TL; DR- Diamond Comic Distributors is a cancer on the comic book industry and the number one culprit in the dwindling number of Local Comic Shops. They have a monopoly on the industry, and they can and will choke small business owners right out of business because of the mismanagement and lack of concern for the very entrepreneurs they rely on to distribute their comics to.",51,1527991366.0,8o2czk,False,"Hey everybody.

These are very expensive comics, Amazing Spider-Man 800 has a $9.99 cover price. And we are still obligated to pay in full for these books, regardless of the fact that many of my customers already got copies elsewhere.

So, Universal Comics has lost out on the sale of all these books, will likely lose subscribers over this, which will dramatically hurt our business, but Diamond and Marvel will still get paid because they have an army of lawyers that can and will crush us if we dispute their unprofessional and contract-breaching failure to deliver. And NONE of this is our fault.

Diamond Comic Distributors has a monopoly on the comic book business, and as such they simply DO NOT CARE how they treat their customers (us, the Local Comic Shops). And we, as retailers, have literally no alternative because Diamond has 100% control over comic book distribution.

Universal Comics has been in business for YEARS longer than Diamond, but is treated like we don't matter, because they have zero incentive to care what happens to us (or any other independent retailer).

I'd like to add here that I'm not being unreasonable in all this. If it were one or maybe two titles we got shorted on, it happens. No one is perfect. But this is becoming a persistent problem. Last week we received 0 copies of invincible Iron Man 600 and 0 copies of Old Man Logan 40. Which has dramatically effected our sales on these titles, as customers went elsewhere to get them. 2 weeks in a row, shorted on some of the year's biggest books, sales tanked as a result, and now many of our subscribers are angry with us and considering leaving. All thanks to Diamond Comic Distributors' failure to fulfill their obligations.

TL; DR- Diamond Comic Distributors is a cancer on the comic book industry and the number one culprit in the dwindling number of Local Comic Shops. They have a monopoly on the industry, and they can and will choke small business owners right out of business because of the mismanagement and lack of concern for the very entrepreneurs they rely on to distribute their comics to.",0,"Hey everybody. My name is Gordon. I own a small comic shop in Baltimore, Maryland called Universal Comics. I'm going to post a little inside baseball here. It may be less than professional, but I do believe it is warranted because the actions of Diamond Comic Distributors are FAR less than professional.

This week, Universal Comics received 0 copies of Amazing Spider-Man 800, 0 copies of Punisher 225, 0 copies of Daredevil 603, 0 copies of Star Wars Lando Double or Nothing, 0 copies of Amazing Spider-Man Renew Your Vows, only 2 copies of You Are Deadpool 5, and faced serious shortages on multiple other titles I can't even think of off the top of my head here.. despite having submitted our order over 2 months ago on time, well before the Final Order Cutoff. Many other retailers in the area received hundreds, in some cases thousands, of copies of the aforementioned titles.

Diamond knew exactly how many copies to order from Marvel 2 months ago, and they knew exactly how many copies I ordered before the deadline. Every retailer is contractually obligated to pay in full at the time of pickup, regardless of any extenuating circumstances, which is an obligation Universal Comics has never failed to meet in all the time Diamond Comic Distributors has existed. Diamond has zero risk in all this.

Marvel knew exactly how many copies to print of these books, as they were told how many were needed by Diamond Comic Distributors over 2 months ago. Marvel has zero risk in all this.

"Hello everyone! I don't make text posts often so I apologize if there are any formatting issues ahead of time.

This happened a few days ago at a local community swimming pool. As expected of any community center, you get people of all different levels of athletic prowess there, so the standard of ""fast"" in the ""fast swimming lane"" is usually set pretty low because a lot of elderly frequent come here. Regardless, I went in on a day that wasn't too busy, but busy enough for me to become 1 of 3 people that occupied the fast lane. 

There was one very slow swimmer (SS) who happened to be in the lane doing god knows what, an impatient swimmer (IS) who isn't slow but definitely not the fastest (seeing as I've caught up to him several times and eventually swam past), and myself. It's also common etiquette to switch to a slower lane if you find yourself being passed too many times by faster swimmers.

At some point, SS started swimming at a snail's pace dead center in the lane, with myself right behind him. Since he was swimming right in the center, I couldn't swim past him, so I slowed down to look for an opportunity to do so. But doing so only gave IS the opportunity to finally catch up to me from behind. 

I get a tap on my shoulder in the middle of the pool, only to have IS rudely push past me and say, ""The fast lane is for fast swimmers only, and you're too slow to be here!"" After he pushes past me, he catches up with SS to say the same thing and kick SS out of the lane.

So I got pretty annoyed at that, because I was not the one who was slow in this lane. I was slow because I was held back by SS who was in front of me. And normally, I'd gladly switch to a medium speed lane if an athlete happened to be training. But in this case, IS wasn't an athlete by any means since, like I said earlier, I already caught up to him several times before this.

So of course, I do what he asks. The fast lane is for fast swimmers, right? 

I speed up and start swimming faster -- fast enough to catch up to IS, but never passing. Just always there behind him, almost able to touch his toes in front of me, and always being there when he'd get to the end of the lane so that the moment he turns around, he sees me trailing closely behind him, always pressuring him to swim faster to increase the gap between us. But once again, always right behind and never passing.

After doing this for about 5 laps, I eventually get bored and get out of the pool to go to the change room. 

I've never seen anyone look so relieved to see me go.",14,1528002255.0,8o3l9e,False,"Hello everyone! I don't make text posts often so I apologize if there are any formatting issues ahead of time.

Just always there behind him, almost able to touch his toes in front of me, and always being there when he'd get to the end of the lane so that the moment he turns around, he sees me trailing closely behind him, always pressuring him to swim faster to increase the gap between us. But once again, always right behind and never passing.

After doing this for about 5 laps, I eventually get bored and get out of the pool to go to the change room. 

I've never seen anyone look so relieved to see me go.",0,"Hello everyone! I don't make text posts often so I apologize if there are any formatting issues ahead of time.

This happened a few days ago at a local community swimming pool. As expected of any community center, you get people of all different levels of athletic prowess there, so the standard of ""fast"" in the ""fast swimming lane"" is usually set pretty low because a lot of elderly frequent come here. Regardless, I went in on a day that wasn't too busy, but busy enough for me to become 1 of 3 people that occupied the fast lane. 

There was one very slow swimmer (SS) who happened to be in the lane doing god knows what, an impatient swimmer (IS) who isn't slow but definitely not the fastest (seeing as I've caught up to him several times and eventually swam past), and myself. It's also common etiquette to switch to a slower lane if you find yourself being passed too many times by faster swimmers.

At some point, SS started swimming at a snail's pace dead center in the lane, with myself right behind him. Since he was swimming right in the center, I couldn't swim past him, so I slowed down to look for an opportunity to do so. But doing so only gave IS the opportunity to finally catch up to me from behind. 

I get a tap on my shoulder in the middle of the pool, only to have IS rudely push past me and say, ""The fast lane is for fast swimmers only, and you're too slow to be here!"" After he pushes past me, he catches up with SS to say the same thing and kick SS out of the lane.

So I got pretty annoyed at that, because I was not the one who was slow in this lane. I was slow because I was held back by SS who was in front of me. And normally, I'd gladly switch to a medium speed lane if an athlete happened to be training. But in this case, IS wasn't an athlete by any means since, like I said earlier, I already caught up to him several times before this.

So of course, I do what he asks. The fast lane is for fast swimmers, right?

"Last month I was at home, standing at the sink, washing dishes. 100% awake. 

My husband walks in the living room, sits down on the couch, and says “hey. I was thinking. We deserve a cheat-day. We should go get a snowball, I want a stuffed grape one so bad right now.”

(We’re on a really strict diet, lol, lots of cravings)

“Ooooh, that sounds good. Can we get Mexican too?” I turned to look at him, but he wasn’t there. 

Now, I had WATCHED HIM sit on the couch. Our couch is leather so when you get up/sit down it makes noise. I would have known if he had gotten up. 

I figured whatever, didn’t hear him get up. Cool. Going deaf. 

Five/six minutes later, I’m finishing the dishes, he comes walking down the hallway and I hear him saying “I mean that sounds good, but what about sushi?” 

When he reached the living room and saw me standing in the kitchen he turned and looked down the hallway. 

“How the hell did you do that?” 

“Do what?”

“You were just walking behind me down the hallway! How did you get ahead of me?”

I started to freak out a little, told him what just happened with me, and his jaw DROPPED. 

“I just had that exact conversation with you in our room! Holy shit.”

We both remarked on how weird that was, but decided we must have been yelling across the house and our brains filled in the rest. No big deal. 

We went out for a snowball and sushi burritos (compromise!) then went home. The rest of the day was completely normal. 

Two days later I’m working at my desk in our house when I get a phone call from him. He’s losing his shit, talking a mile a minute, barely taking breaths between sentences. I finally get him to slow down and he says “Where. The. Fuck. Are. You.” 

“I’m at home. I’m working here today, remember?” 

“Tabby... I just saw you. I just fucking saw you standing on the side of the road. I stopped and you started walking toward the car and then I realized I’m 30 minutes away from home and I’ve got the car.” 

 Something felt wrong. Why would he have seen me? Why would I be on the side of a road? I hung up the phone. I waited a minute or two and called him back. 

He answered on the 3rd ring. 

“Hey baby is everything okay? I’m working.” 

I told him I was fine, and I’d see him when he got home. 

“Okay tab, I love you.”

My heart started racing. He never calls me tab. Ever. That may seem little, but James is a creature of habit. Even when he’s distracted. It’s always Tabby, or Tabitha. Everything felt wrong. I hung up the phone and threw it down. He called me 4 more times that day. 

I didn’t answer. 

Part of me felt paranoid, but I also felt justified. Something was up. Something was screwing with my head. 

When James got home everything seemed okay. I still felt off, but I began to attribute that to me quitting my anxiety meds cold turkey. He even looked weird to me. “Maybe my perception is just different” I thought.

I began to rationalize all of the weird things, like the phone calls and him looking “off”. James would probably call me tab if he was distracted. The whole panicked phone call still didn’t make sense... but maybe I imagined it? Me quitting my meds had more to do with his looking weird than anything else, right?

It made sense, right?

Days went by without incident. James and I weren’t talking much. I felt distant. He mostly played on his computer when he was home. I was afraid of him, of myself, of my own mind. 

I felt like he was always watching. Out of the corner of my eyes I would see him staring straight at me, whole body turned towards me, but when I turned to look he was intent on his computer screen. 

I dreaded being home with him. I dreaded being out without him. He started to pop-up in places I went. Logically, I knew it was impossible that he was there, but I would see him. Standing. Staring. Waiting. 

I was last week I woke up to him standing over our bed. Mouth agape, eyes pools of black. “Help... me...” He croaked, barely audible. 

I reached out to touch his arm. I knew now why he hadn’t looked right. He has a wine stain birthmark on his arm right below his elbow. 

I felt the James-thing behind me sit up. I looked at my James, standing in front of me, eyes empty and slack-jawed, and I screamed. 

The James-thing lunged at him, ripping through his body with claws that were impossibly long and sharp. 

He crumpled to the ground. 

Here lied, on my floor, the body of my husband.  

“He had to turn around. Make sure it was you.” 

The voice was no longer James’ but something ancient. Evil. 

I knew in my heart I was next, whatever he did to James, I was next. 

While he was distracted with my husband’s body, I made a split-second decision. 

I jumped through my bedroom window, and I ran. Screaming, crying, bloody. 

Someone finally called the cops. They picked me up and brought me to the hospital. They found James’ body, they said it was an animal attack. 

They’re saying I have PTSD. 

I know what happened. 

And I know I keep seeing James. ",12,1527987457.0,8o1wl4,False,"Last month I was at home, standing at the sink, washing dishes. 100% awake. 

My husband walks in the living room, sits down on the couch, and says “hey. I was thinking. We deserve a cheat-day. We should go get a snowball, I want a stuffed grape one so bad right now.”

(We’re on a really strict diet, lol, lots of cravings)

“Ooooh, that sounds good. Can we get Mexican too?” I turned to look at him, but he wasn’t there. 

Now, I had WATCHED HIM sit on the couch. Our couch is leather so when you get up/sit down it makes noise. I would have known if he had gotten up. 

I figured whatever, didn’t hear him get up. Cool. Going deaf. 

Five/six minutes later, I’m finishing the dishes, he comes walking down the hallway and I hear him saying “I mean that sounds good, but what about sushi?” 

When he reached the living room and saw me standing in the kitchen he turned and looked down the hallway. 

“How the hell did you do that?” 

“Do what?”

“You were just walking behind me down the hallway! How did you get ahead of me?”

I started to freak out a little, told him what just happened with me, and his jaw DROPPED. 

“I just had that exact conversation with you in our room! Holy shit.”

We both remarked on how weird that was, but decided we must have been yelling across the house and our brains filled in the rest. No big deal. 

We went out for a snowball and sushi burritos (compromise!) then went home. The rest of the day was completely normal. 

Two days later I’m working at my desk in our house when I get a phone call from him. He’s losing his shit, talking a mile a minute, barely taking breaths between sentences. I finally get him to slow down and he says “Where. The. Fuck. Are. You.” 

“I’m at home. I’m working here today, remember?” 

“Tabby... I just saw you. I just fucking saw you standing on the side of the road. I stopped and you started walking toward the car and then I realized I’m 30 minutes away from home and I’ve got the car.” 

 Something felt wrong. Why would he have seen me? Why would I be on the side of a road? I hung up the phone. I waited a minute or two and called him back. 

He answered on the 3rd ring. 

“Hey baby is everything okay? I’m working.” 

I told him I was fine, and I’d see him when he got home. 

“Okay tab, I love you.”

My heart started racing. He never calls me tab. Ever. That may seem little, but James is a creature of habit. Even when he’s distracted. It’s always Tabby, or Tabitha. Everything felt wrong. I hung up the phone and threw it down. He called me 4 more times that day. 

I didn’t answer. 

Part of me felt paranoid, but I also felt justified. Something was up. Something was screwing with my head. 

When James got home everything seemed okay. I still felt off, but I began to attribute that to me quitting my anxiety meds cold turkey. He even looked weird to me. “Maybe my perception is just different” I thought.

I began to rationalize all of the weird things, like the phone calls and him looking “off”. James would probably call me tab if he was distracted. The whole panicked phone call still didn’t make sense... but maybe I imagined it? Me quitting my meds had more to do with his looking weird than anything else, right?

It made sense, right?

Days went by without incident. James and I weren’t talking much. I felt distant. He mostly played on his computer when he was home. I was afraid of him, of myself, of my own mind. 

I felt like he was always watching. Out of the corner of my eyes I would see him staring straight at me, whole body turned towards me, but when I turned to look he was intent on his computer screen. 

I dreaded being home with him. I dreaded being out without him. He started to pop-up in places I went. Logically, I knew it was impossible that he was there, but I would see him. Standing. Staring. Waiting. 

I was last week I woke up to him standing over our bed. Mouth agape, eyes pools of black. “Help... me...” He croaked, barely audible. 

I reached out to touch his arm. I knew now why he hadn’t looked right. He has a wine stain birthmark on his arm right below his elbow. 

I felt the James-thing behind me sit up. I looked at my James, standing in front of me, eyes empty and slack-jawed, and I screamed. 

The James-thing lunged at him, ripping through his body with claws that were impossibly long and sharp. 

He crumpled to the ground.

"Conversation turned inevitably to what should be done next. Dorn activated a hololith depicting the whole wheel of the galaxy. Sunlight streamed through it, staining the stars bloody. 'This is our disposition,' said Dorn. 'Here, at Terra, we now have four Legions. The Lion pursues his policy of vengeance. Guilliman harries the traitors as he advances upon Terra.'

'He should have come directly,' said Jaghatai. 'Swift movement wins battles.'

'He thought it better one Legion got through rather than none,' said Sanguinius. 'Between them, the Lion and Guilliman have split the traitors' forces. We will have fewer enemy to face when Horus' hammer blow falls. Lion El'Jonson bleeds his strength, Guilliman pushes him on towards us. Their diversions allowed me through. We are at last in a position to dictate the course of the war. We can win.'

'We are also split,' said the Khan. 'Six Legions could have been here.'

'They outnumber us greatly,' said Sanguinius. 'Dividing their forces was the wisest action. They cannot be allowed to bring their full might to bear here.'

Dorn nodded. 'Sanguinius is right. The Lion's campaign will buy us time, and Guilliman's activities give us the precious gift of choosing our own timing.'

'How much time?' said the Khan.

'It doesn't matter how much time we gain,' said Russ. 'It isn't enough. We have seen Sanguinius' ships, the Khan's.' Russ drank deeply of his wine. 'Mine. Our fleets are depleted. Mars is in open revolt. We do not have time, brothers. Horus still has two choices, he can attack us here, and smash what little remains of our strength, or wear us down by slow degree until there is nothing left. Either way, he wins.'

'That was true a few weeks ago,' said Dorn. 'His hand is forced. Thanks to the actions of our brothers the Ruinstorm is blowing out. Now we can muster our strength, he will attack directly. He will wish to lay siege to Terra before Guilliman can bring his warriors here from Ultramar. With the Lion laying waste to the traitor's domains, his own ability to reinforce will be compromised. There will be no attrition now. We are engaged in a race.'

'Guilliman's Legion is largely intact,' said Sanguinius. 'And he can call upon the full might of the Five Hundred Worlds. Lorgar and Angron wrought havoc there but Guilliman's realm is large and well organised. His is the largest Legion. Horus' forces have all suffered losses, many of them self-inflicted. Do not overestimate their strength. Horus will move against us soon, when he does not wish to.'

'I do not doubt it,' said Russ. 'Still, we have no opportunity to replenish our fleets. We are not ready to bear the brunt of an assault on Terra. Alpharius' incursion should have taught us that.'

A muscle twinge at the line of Dorn's silver hair betrayed his annoyance at Russ' statement 'You are also correct. We do need to strike back,' said Dorn. 'Now we have provoked him, we have to slow the Warmaster. If fortune is with us, we might even stop him before he gets to Terra. We can decide this strategy. It is now the Warmaster who must react and not us.'

'Facing him before our forces are gathered will cost a lot of blood,' said Russ.

'Where do you propose we make this stand?' said the Khan.

'We have so many Titans here,' said Dorn. 'We cannot unleash them upon Terra. Their kind of war would be the undoing of the Throneworld. My intention is to hold Horus at Beta-Garmon.' The system in question blinked. The hololith zoomed into it at a gesture from Dorn. He pointed at it with his calloused, craftsman's hand. 'Seven major warp routes cross here. It has been contested since the beginning of the war. If we commit the majority of our forces to Beta-Garmon, we can hold Horus and our traitorous brothers there.'

'And grind them out like cinders,' said Sanguinius. 'I do not see a better proposition.'

Russ shook his head. 'It brings us back to attrition. They have the numbers. If we cannot best Horus quickly there, he will overcome us. Once Beta-Garmon is lost, the way to Terra is open. What will we defend ourselves with then?'

'This kind of defensive war is your preference, Rogal,' said the Khan, 'but it is not to my liking. We risk becoming ensnared there. There are other routes to Terra. He could hold our forces in place at Beta-Garmon and outflank us.'

'Our hunting brother is right,' said Russ. 'Beta-Garmon is a hell trap, and one that will too easily divide our forces, for must we not retain a portion of our strength here to fortify Terra? Fight him there, we are divided, fight him here, he has time to gather his strength. Horus has us outmanoeuvred.'

'Any battle at Beta-Garmon will be bloody, there is no doubt of that,' said Dorn. 'The casualty figures I have projected are high, but they are bearable, and they will give us more time to fortify Terra. Guilliman will come from the galactic south-east, and trap Horus either at Beta-Garmon, or if he breaks through, against the wall of iron I have cast about this world.'
",63,1527984576.0,8o1kxm,False,"Conversation turned inevitably to what should be done next. Dorn activated a hololith depicting the whole wheel of the galaxy. Sunlight streamed through it, staining the stars bloody. 'This is our disposition,' said Dorn. 'Here, at Terra, we now have four Legions. The Lion pursues his policy of vengeance. Guilliman harries the traitors as he advances upon Terra.'

'He should have come directly,' said Jaghatai. 'Swift movement wins battles.'

'He thought it better one Legion got through rather than none,' said Sanguinius. 'Between them, the Lion and Guilliman have split the traitors' forces. We will have fewer enemy to face when Horus' hammer blow falls. Lion El'Jonson bleeds his strength, Guilliman pushes him on towards us. Their diversions allowed me through. We are at last in a position to dictate the course of the war. We can win.'

'We are also split,' said the Khan. 'Six Legions could have been here.'

'They outnumber us greatly,' said Sanguinius. 'Dividing their forces was the wisest action. They cannot be allowed to bring their full might to bear here.'

Dorn nodded. 'Sanguinius is right. The Lion's campaign will buy us time, and Guilliman's activities give us the precious gift of choosing our own timing.'

'How much time?' said the Khan.

'It doesn't matter how much time we gain,' said Russ. 'It isn't enough. We have seen Sanguinius' ships, the Khan's.' Russ drank deeply of his wine. 'Mine. Our fleets are depleted. Mars is in open revolt. We do not have time, brothers. Horus still has two choices, he can attack us here, and smash what little remains of our strength, or wear us down by slow degree until there is nothing left. Either way, he wins.'

'That was true a few weeks ago,' said Dorn. 'His hand is forced. Thanks to the actions of our brothers the Ruinstorm is blowing out. Now we can muster our strength, he will attack directly. He will wish to lay siege to Terra before Guilliman can bring his warriors here from Ultramar. With the Lion laying waste to the traitor's domains, his own ability to reinforce will be compromised. There will be no attrition now. We are engaged in a race.'

'Guilliman's Legion is largely intact,' said Sanguinius. 'And he can call upon the full might of the Five Hundred Worlds. Lorgar and Angron wrought havoc there but Guilliman's realm is large and well organised. His is the largest Legion. Horus' forces have all suffered losses, many of them self-inflicted. Do not overestimate their strength. Horus will move against us soon, when he does not wish to.'

'I do not doubt it,' said Russ. 'Still, we have no opportunity to replenish our fleets. We are not ready to bear the brunt of an assault on Terra. Alpharius' incursion should have taught us that.'

A muscle twinge at the line of Dorn's silver hair betrayed his annoyance at Russ' statement 'You are also correct. We do need to strike back,' said Dorn. 'Now we have provoked him, we have to slow the Warmaster. If fortune is with us, we might even stop him before he gets to Terra. We can decide this strategy. It is now the Warmaster who must react and not us.'

'Facing him before our forces are gathered will cost a lot of blood,' said Russ.

ME: I had my schedule for over two weeks. I have confidence that the ScheduleRight system and the managers here made an appropriate decision.

"Warning, crypto jargon ahead.

Unfortunately, the code is heavily obfuscated, but based on what I was able to (and cared to) deobfuscate, this is roughly how it works:

1. Before anything happens, the app generates and stores locally a key pair
2. The phone connects to the car over BLE
3. Once a BLE connection is established, the app sends a request to the car for its public key. In this request packet, the app includes its own public key's **ID**, but not the public key itself.
4. The car responds with a certificate, out of which the app extracts the car's public key. This public key is ephemeral (short-lived) and isn't validated by the app in any way.
5. Once the app has its own key pair generated and the car's public key, it derives a symmetric secret using ECDH.
6. The app requests a list from the car of ""whitelisted"" public key IDs. If the app's key isn't in the whitelist, it stops activity but stays connected.
7. The app requests the car's capabilities (I'm unsure what these are)
8. The app requests from the car its permissions (Add To Whitelist, Local Unlock, Local Drive, Remote Unlock, Remote Drive, Change Permissions, Remove From Whitelist, Remove Self From Whitelist)
9. The app syncs some kind of ""crypto counter"" with the car
10. The app requests the car's status, which appears to be whether it's locked or not (4 possible statuses: Unlocked, Locked, Internal Locked, Selective Unlocked) and the ""closure state"" of the doors (closed, open, ajar, unknown)

Other interesting values:

**Authentication Levels**

- None
- Unlock
- Drive

**Actions**

- Unlock
- Lock
- Open Trunk
- Open Frunk
- Open Charge Port
- Close Charge Port
- Cancel External Authenticate (appears unused)

There are also some references to signed messages in here. I'm not sure if this means all messages are signed, some messages are signed, or no messages are signed. That said, I'm unsure message signatures are necessary at all considering the key exchange mechanism, assuming that the symmetric crypto (most likely AES) also has a MAC.

I'm a crypto hobbyist, not an expert, but as far as I can tell, the fact that the car's public key isn't authenticated isn't a problem. From the code I saw, the phone app never actually sends its public key to the car over BLE, only its key ID. I assume that the public key is sent to the Tesla server and then to the car securely over LTE, and then the car stores the public key. That's how the car authenticates the phone.

So when the phone connects, the car sends it a short-lived public key and both sides do ECDH to derive a shared key. Someone could theoretically pretend to be the car and get the app to do a handshake with them, but without knowing the phone app's public key, the malicious actor couldn't derive the same shared secret as the phone. So theoretically messages wouldn't need to be signed at all to be secure, since they're going over a securely encrypted channel.

But the takeaway here is that Tesla is definitely, absolutely, doing asymmetric encryption with its phone key system, making it more secure than a traditional rolling code key fob.",48,1527987692.0,8o1xko,False,"Warning, crypto jargon ahead.

"I have worked for a large resort in Alaska with a high employee turnover rate since November 2016. I’ve always been one of the better employees, most of my co-workers are ski bums and stoners while I’m working there to pay my way through graduate school. I’ve never been reprimanded or in trouble of any sort and my manager even filled out an employee of the season nomination form for me in April (unfortunately, he forgot to turn it in by the deadline.)

In March, accounting contacted my manager alleging I was $100 short in my nightly cash drop (5x20 bills). Both my manager and I felt this was very hard to believe considering we had both separately counted it, verified it, and signed off on it.  We voiced our concerns and asked how I could go about contesting the claim. Accounting said I couldn’t contest anything and just had to pay it. My manager requested a copy of the back of the cash drop envelope, where he had personally signed and written the amount he counted before he sealed it. Accounting refused to provide the documentation and in short, said it didn’t matter.  My manager continued to exhaust all possibilities, even going so far as to ask why an accountant seemingly abruptly left around this time.

In May, a new male co-worker repeatedly harassed me at work. Early harassment included verbally berating me in front of guests, almost lighting my hair on fire with a lighter, pushing me when I walked by, slapping cups out of my hands in front of guests and more. I reported this all to my assistant manager one evening who said he would talk with the employee. I then followed it up a few days later by speaking with the primary manager. I told him I was uncomfortable working with this male co-worker, to which he replied “it’s all schoolboy pranks.” When the weekly schedule came out the following day, I was scheduled to work every single shift next to my harasser.  I endured this for a few days until the harassment turned sexual and my co-worker, unprovoked, said to me “if you saw my  [tinder profile], you would suck my dick.”

The next day, I confided in a female manager from another outlet about the situation who immediately took me to HR, where I wrote out a report about various encounters.  The director of my department got involved and is now trying to “promote me” into a high-end outlet, though I would prefer not to have to be the one to leave. When I was able to meet with the director of HR, she assured me actions would be taken against my harasser and my immediate managers, who failed to help me, would have to go through “retraining.” She again pitched the “promotion” to me, saying I should be excited for the future. I reiterated how I felt management and the company had failed me and didn’t respond appropriately to my early concerns, leaving me vulnerable to additional harassment. 

Within two hours of walking out of that meeting (on a Friday at 4:30pm), I was served with papers from accounting that I was “required to sign” immediately. The paper again alleges I owe the resort $100 and I have to options 1) admit fault, repay the money and risk facing disciplinary action or 2) do not admit fault and risk termination and/or prosecution. I immediately told my manager I was not signing anything.

My question is, how do I proceed from here? Am I wrong to believe being served this accounting paper is correlated to my meeting with HR where I discussed how I felt both the management and the resort had failed to protect me from harassment? Do I have to sign this paper, ‘okaying’ possible termination or prosecution without any process to contest the claim?

"Hello all, this might be a little wholesome for this subreddit but here goes \(FYI  I am being intentionally vague with the details so I can't be traced\).

The background is that our company went through a massive restructure a couple of years ago. Many good people were squeezed out and the rest of us barely hung on. To top it off they had brought in an expensive consultancy who told us that we were losing too much money, hence the layoffs. As usual the redundancies didn't reach past middle\-management level and the upper echelons all received bonuses for their hard work in laying off the rest of us. Needless to say many of us are still a little sore.

It was decided recently that following this restructure we should create a new Team Charter to outline our purpose, define our scope and to reflect the new directions we are taking. However, since morale was at and all time low and it was decided that bulk of this new Charter should be crowd\-sourced by the remaining staff. I could see why they thought this might be a good idea, if we help to come up with our own Corporate Mission then we would be more likely to have pride in the company again.

However, the North remembers.

We sat through several presentations trying to get us to define our new charter, countless cups of coffee drunk, many trays of fancy biscuits consumed, quite a few games of buzzword bingo were played. I went on at least three workshop days myself where we covered a very professional looking board with our ideas in post\-it notes with the sole intention to stretch this out as long as possible. Each day at a workshop was a late start \(in at 9.30 to start at 10am\); drinks, snacks and lunch and \(best of all\) we would finish for the day at around 3pm.

It couldn't last forever though, the Senior Management eventually gave us a strict deadline and insisted that if we couldn't come up with a Charter by the end of the day with an overall majority then they would be going with their own idea.

Fine by us. So after months of workshops we called a vote which as passed unanimously and Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present our company's new Team Charter in its entirety...

Fine by us. So after months of workshops we called a vote which as passed unanimously and Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present our company's new Team Charter in its entirety...

""Be Excellent To Each Other""

\(We really tried to get Party On Dudes too \- they managed to strike that, something something professionalism\)",0,"Hello all, this might be a little wholesome for this subreddit but here goes \(FYI  I am being intentionally vague with the details so I can't be traced\).

The background is that our company went through a massive restructure a couple of years ago. Many good people were squeezed out and the rest of us barely hung on. To top it off they had brought in an expensive consultancy who told us that we were losing too much money, hence the layoffs. As usual the redundancies didn't reach past middle\-management level and the upper echelons all received bonuses for their hard work in laying off the rest of us. Needless to say many of us are still a little sore.

It was decided recently that following this restructure we should create a new Team Charter to outline our purpose, define our scope and to reflect the new directions we are taking. However, since morale was at and all time low and it was decided that bulk of this new Charter should be crowd\-sourced by the remaining staff. I could see why they thought this might be a good idea, if we help to come up with our own Corporate Mission then we would be more likely to have pride in the company again.

However, the North remembers.

We sat through several presentations trying to get us to define our new charter, countless cups of coffee drunk, many trays of fancy biscuits consumed, quite a few games of buzzword bingo were played. I went on at least three workshop days myself where we covered a very professional looking board with our ideas in post\-it notes with the sole intention to stretch this out as long as possible. Each day at a workshop was a late start \(in at 9.30 to start at 10am\); drinks, snacks and lunch and \(best of all\) we would finish for the day at around 3pm.

"I’ve told this from my sister’s point of view. Saying “my sisters husbands sister” seemed too confusing.

My sister-in-law called me last week crying that they were getting evicted and had no where to go. Her father’s is no longer an option as she has screwed him over so many times he wants nothing to do with her. She, along with her husband and 5yr old son, are in Kansas and want to come down to Texas to stay with us until they can get back on their feet. Wanting to be a good wife I agree and we send them $100 we don’t have to help get them down here. They rent a vehicle and tell us they are on their way. 

That night they call and say the rental broke down, but the rental place can’t replace it until morning and are covering a hotel room for them. Next day she says she has to take her son to the ER because he is sick. The day after that they decide they are going to stay in southern Kansas (that’s right, didn’t even make it out of the state) because her husband found a job. 

Not going to lie, I was relieved... Until yesterday. It turns out that he had no job and instead they were using the 4 days as a “vacation” to stop and see all the sights on everyone else’s borrowed money. The Sister-in-law calls me again saying they really need to come down to Texas because they are out of money. We try to explain that we didn’t think it was going to work out and we already sent them the only money we had. Somehow they manage to get down to us and we let them know they are going to have to sleep in the living room until we get the spare room cleaned out. (Keep in mind we live in a single wide trailer). This is unacceptable to the husband. He does not want to sleep in the living room. He wants us to pay for a hotel room.

After he threatens to take the car and abandon his wife and child we agree.

"The fact that PUBG is in near free fall is beyond dispute. The fact that there are many contributing factors to this and not just China and its hacker infested player base is also beyond dispute.

But for more than half a year now people in the EU and NA have been asking for China to be region locked, not because it's China but because (quoting BattlEye here) 99% of the hackers in this game come from China.

That request has been met with derision by the likes of Blue Hole and Playerunknown (I don't need to remind you of the infamous comment about western players being xenophobes do I?).

Less known is how in my opinion Blue Hole put pressure directly and indirectly on all its Youtube and Twitch partners to specifically avoid talking about the hacker issue originating from China. And it paid off. Hardly any major streamer or youtuber talked about this. Except this essentially communist approach to the issue doesn't work. Because while the streamers and youtubers can be bribed or threatened into submission the ordinary player can't. 

He or she will still play the game if it is enjoyable. And besides all the other issues affecting PUBG, from the lack of proper updates, to the abysmal performance, to the servers and dsync etc etc, the one overriding issues has been cheating. Chinese cheating.

The fact is no matter how much the ""stars"" on youtube and twitch avoid the issue, the average player will eventually get tired of being killed by hackers. And he or she will move on to another game.

The Oceania region is a case in point. They launched regional servers, then they allowed the Chinese to flood in and soon enough a lot of Australian and New Zeeland players had enough and quit after their complaints were again dismissed and nothing was done.

The same happens on a much larger scale in Europe and North America. One by one, first a player, then his or her friends, then their friends, quit this game in disgust. Yes, a small group will still remain and still play. It happens in every game. But beyond the hardcore there will pretty much be nothing left. 

And the hilarious thing about this sad f-ing saga of pandering to Chinese hackers by Blue Hole is the Chinese are also quitting the game for many reasons. But a lot of them are quitting because when on an EU or NA server half the people are also from China, their entertainment which consists of playing or hacking against the ""imperialist"" westerners kind of goes away.

In the end, without a hard region lock and ping lock system in place PUBG will very soon end up with only a handful of players in all regions. And all because when people complained about Chinese hackers the answer was ""you xenophobes"". 

Well, people vote with their feet and your game is dying fast and so are your delusions of building a sustainable micro-transaction based revenue source for years to come. Because when western players have enough of this shit and walk away so do their wallets.

"So, I recently finished my first real, long-term D&D campaign.  It ran for five years and ~70 “episodes”) (with some hiatuses), both in-person and over Roll20, was entirely homebrew, took players from level 1 to level 14, and honestly is probably one of the bigger creative accomplishments of my life.  I’ve been reflecting on the experience of DMing a campaign like this and what I’ve learned from it, and wanted to share a few of the more important lessons that I’ll take into my next DMing gig.  Broadly, I found that the three big axes around which I could “optimize” the health of my game were: “player agency,” “campaign fidelity,” and “DM sanity.”  I didn’t explicitly call these categories out below for the most part, but this tri-axis system really came to inform a lot of what I did and how I learned from my experiences, so I thought I’d mention it.

For context, I basically started DMing in earnest at the start of the D&D Next Playtest (Summer 2012) and started this campaign in Summer 2013. So, still pretty green when I started, but hey, it worked out!  I know everyone hates those self-indulgent “LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY CAMPAIGN!!!” stories, so I’ve tried to keep examples from being overly frilly – of course, I’m happy to go into detail on any stories that would be helpful, but wanted to keep the lessons themselves as the focus, not my campaign.  I also don’t really like it when DMs present their own experiences as universally applicable and treat their advice as imperative, so I’ve tried hard to make it clear these lessons were meaningful to ME personally -- I hope they are also meaningful to you but I understand that everyone’s DM style and needs are different.  Anyway, without further ado, here they are:

----------

The single most important lesson I learned is to be flexible. One way to do that is to treat your story more like a TV show than a novel.
----------

I once heard the writers of a network TV show talk about how they went about planning and writing their story.  They started with the central premise and a strong idea of where they wanted to start and end.  They had a well-defined concept of the WHAT of their story (say, “The Story We Want To Tell”)  BUT, they also recognized that the WHAT (“The Story We Want To Tell”) wasn’t synonymous with the HOW (“The Way We Tell Our Story”)  They were ready to write characters out entirely, extend or compact seasons, divert storylines, and so on, because TV is episodic and subject to the whims of the network, audience, actors, etc.  Contrast that to novels, where the author literally has absolute control over both The Story They Want To Tell and The Way They Tell Their Story. Both of those conceptions work to perfectly craft exactly the right narrative, told in exactly the right way.  This great power helps the novelist make the story As Good As Possible, but it’s just not a power available to TV showmakers – or DMs writing their own campaign.
 
For my campaign, the premise was “what if the PCs lived in one of multiple parallel worlds created by the gods at different levels of ‘entropy’?” I built the whole story from that question.  I had a strong idea of how I’d start the story, how the PCs would discover the multiple worlds, and how the story would end.  BUT I didn’t know which of my players would stay or leave.  I didn’t know which NPCs would become important or not.  I didn’t know which hooks players would explore or ignore.  **Treating my story less like a novel and more like a TV show, with a strong idea of What Story I Wanted To Tell but flexibility in How I Told My Story, enabled the campaign to progress organically, meeting both my goals and the players’ needs throughout each arc, all the way to the end.** In fact, I literally broke my campaign into “seasons” and treated sessions as discrete “episodes” leading to “season finales,” etc.  It helped my organization and my mindset tremendously, provided natural break points and places for players to step away or join the campaign, and so on.  I really cannot recommend being flexible in this way enough.
 
Flexibility and Planning Are Two Sides of the Same Creative Coin
------

I’ve seen a lot of DMs online talk about the importance of developing “improv” as a skill.  Personally I suck pretty badly at improv.  And to be honest I don’t think Online DMs really understand what they are saying when they suggest this.  Usually it’s framed as “your games will go better if you’re good at improv and don’t force your session to rigidly conform to your plan!” But, strictly speaking, improv is the practiced performance skill of creating a compelling performance from unscripted/unplanned material, not simply the ability to successfully -- and _flexibly_ -- implement a plan in adverse conditions without clinging dogmatically to a crystallized set of rules.  Improv, defined as above, _can_ be a useful skill for DMs, but _by definition,_ it eschews planning in favor of adaptation, so the ability to implement long-term narrative structures such as foreshadowing is limited to the scope of the improv itself, since nothing outside of the improv’s unplanned material can be brought in. There’s nothing wrong with that! **But I think it’s entirely possible to be flexible and adapt, allowing your players to exhibit agency and be creative -- all while still planning and plotting to your heart’s content.**
 
For me, I found that my ability to contingency-plan and create organized story structures (within the framework described above) made it easier to be flexible in those moments when my players deviated from my “ideal” path.  It didn’t mean I had to abandon my plans or come up with content on the fly.  It just meant I had to use observation and analysis skills to read the situation and decide which set pieces to play or delay, when to pivot, etc. **I had enough contingency plans that instead of “improving,” I was able to be flexible by choosing from several options I had already thought about.**  This reduced my in-game stress considerably, because I honestly do suck at coming up with things on the fly most of the time.  And look, just to be clear, there will always be that one session where you didn’t have time to prep, or you weren’t able to predict your players’ latest weird obsession.  Improving a fun session or two when you need to is a good skill to have, if only so the fun doesn’t stop.  But what I’m saying is that I found smart, rigorous pre-planning a more “flexible” option than resigning myself to making things up as I went – and I don’t think it’s necessary to take that path if you don’t want to.
 

You Can Have It All: “Railroad vs. Sandbox” Is (Sometimes) a False Dichotomy.
-----

 I’m not here to start a big argument about “narrative” or “sandbox” games or whatever.  It’s my personal opinion that when most people talk about wanting their game to be a “sandbox,” what they really mean is that they want player choices to feel like they matter. 

 I think that (most!) D&D players don’t want to play Wizard Minecraft, walking through a world that does nothing until they interact with it and even then only reacting in kind.  I think most players _do_ want some (or even a lot of) narrative direction, some incentive to take actions, and some risks for their choices.  When people say they don’t want to get railroaded, what I think they mean is that they don’t want to feel like they’re NPCs in the DM’s little private novella. They want their choices to matter.  And I think that players (and some DMs) have picked up on this and operationalized the word “sandbox” to capture these feelings, even though IMO it’s a term not well designed for the usage.  And in the meantime, words like “linear,” “narrative-focused,” etc. have become dirty words.
 
**But I think you can have a well-designed, narratively-rich game that builds a linearly progressive story and delivers on things like foreshadowing and character development while still making your players’ choices have real consequences.**  A linear story doesn’t _require_ your players to feel railroaded. One thing that helped me was making sure that the players always knew that there was more going wrong in the world than they could fix with a single choice. This meant that _every_ big choice they made carried _some_ consequence, and gave them a sense of agency from square one.  I also learned that there were subtle ways to present players with multiple options such that one option was more appealing and players were more likely to pick it.  I also learned to use “magician’s choice” well, giving players more of the illusion of choice than an actual choice, which sounds like a cheat but, honestly, it got the job done for players experiencing a sense of agency, which is what they wanted.  **These tools allowed me to tell The Story I Wanted To Tell while still letting players have their agency in The Way The Story Was Told, keeping them from feeling railroaded and making it smoother for everyone.**
 

Your Players Are Authors Too.
--------

This flows pretty naturally from the immediately prior lesson I think a lot of DMs are scared to let their players have too much agency because they don't want their well-laid plans to go awry.  That's understandable, but I found that my players needed authorship to have fun in my world.  A natural consequence of your players having agency in your world is that they’ll indelibly leave their mark on it.  This might seem dangerous but let me tell you it actually made my job a lot easier.  Being diligent about listening to and observing my players during play sessions often led to ideas about where to take the story in ways that worked for both them and me.  The biggest example of this is the party’s main rival villain.  I’ll tell the full story in the comments if you want but the short of it is that this NPC was born out of the players mishearing a name, essentially inventing a new character with the misheard name, and expressing interest in interacting with _THAT_ character rather than the character I had written up for them to face.  Listening to them allowed me to craft a villain they’d find compelling and enjoy/hate interacting with simultaneously.  **The character my players “wrote” themselves ended up becoming the most important NPC they interacted with all campaign, with the best session in the whole campaign devoted to the party’s history and interactions with her -- and that character simply would not have existed if I had “overwritten” the players’ authorship over the world.**  

Now, as a caveat, I do want to say that I worked hard to let my players exhibit authorship in a way that didn’t overturn my own.  You could imagine that following up on too many disparate leads based on players’ expressed interests could easily cause the campaign to turn into the kind of “sandbox” we’d like to avoid, but it’s just something to keep in mind.  Your campaign fidelity is important too!
 
Solicit Feedback CONSTANTLY (Corollary: Your Players Don’t Know What They Want)
-------

As mentioned above, I found that always being observant and attentive to what my players did in sessions helped me craft the campaign to fit their needs.  Asking what they wanted outside of play also helped, and I would recommend anybody to do this frequently.  BUT I found that players did not always accurately articulate what they wanted from the campaign when asked directly.  They would use shorthand like “sandbox” to mean “meaningful choices” (as above), or describe a desire for “character development” when what they really wanted was an opportunity for their character’s mechanical skills to shine -– not quite the ""development"" I would have guessed.  I don’t blame them; almost by definition the players aren’t required to think about this kind of thing.  They’re there to roll some dice and solve some puzzles, and it’s been well documented elsewhere that “consumers” often have trouble articulating (even to themselves!) their desires and preferences.  

**It became really important for me to try to piece together, from players’ stated and enacted objectives for play, what their actual objectives really were.**  I think that developing this skill makes a DM not only much more flexible, but much wiser and much more likely to keep players around as, seemingly without the players needing to ask, the campaign tends to start meeting their needs more and more.
 
Off Days Are Normal.  You Won’t Please Everyone.  You Are Still Good At Your Job.  It’s A Hobby. Your Fun Is Important Too. Etc.
------
This seems like a really simple and smarmy “lesson” to end on, but I wanted to make sure I said it explicitly.  All of these “trite” DM “self-help” adages are nonetheless both extremely true and extremely effective.  Everyone feels like they aren’t skilled or experienced enough as a DM sometimes.  Everyone has that session where everything seems off and it looks like the players aren’t having fun.  These thoughts are normal and **I am telling you straight to your face that you can do this, and the more you practice your craft, the better you will be at it.**  Whether or not these thoughts ever go away is, in my experience, completely orthogonal to how well you actually perform as a DM.  I will tell you stories if you like about the times my players expressed dissatisfaction with things I had done as DM or I left a session just wanting to go bang my head against a wall, or the times I felt like I didn’t know how I’d finish the story in a way that made everyone happy.  I will tell you the story of how one of my players spent an hour of the final campaign session playing Terraria and it was somehow fine.  Just remember, the most important part of the game is showing up week after week, putting your best roll forward. **As a DM, you are the most important person at the table, full stop.  Your enjoyment, mental health, creative fulfillment, etc., all factor highly into how sustainable your campaign is.** So, make those things a priority and I promise the rest will improve.
 
There are a bunch of other lessons I learned as well along the way (“D&D isn’t a video game, so don’t fall into the trap of thinking you have to run it like one, even if your players act like it is,” “Don’t get personally attached to characters, either PCs or NPCs,” “Consistency is good not only for your rulings but your narrative power – don’t threaten to kill someone if you won’t kill them,” etc.) but these I think are the most important and the lessons that really took me from a very beginner, novice DM to someone who can literally say I finished a campaign that took players from level 1 to level 14.

-----------

I’m happy to hang out in the comments if anyone wants to chat about anything or hear stories, but mostly I just hope that, if you’re a new DM, you aren’t daunted by the scope of the hobby.  You already have the capacity to learn all the skills you need.  Practice, work hard, and keep your eye on the prize, and I’m confident you’ll be a great DM, and in time you’ll be able to look back on your own lessons learned from your own successfully-completed campaign.  Roll 20s!

This meant that _every_ big choice they made carried _some_ consequence, and gave them a sense of agency from square one.  I also learned that there were subtle ways to present players with multiple options such that one option was more appealing and players were more likely to pick it.  I also learned to use “magician’s choice” well, giving players more of the illusion of choice than an actual choice, which sounds like a cheat but, honestly, it got the job done for players experiencing a sense of agency, which is what they wanted.  **These tools allowed me to tell The Story I Wanted To Tell while still letting players have their agency in The Way The Story Was Told, keeping them from feeling railroaded and making it smoother for everyone.**
 

Your Players Are Authors Too.
--------

This flows pretty naturally from the immediately prior lesson I think a lot of DMs are scared to let their players have too much agency because they don't want their well-laid plans to go awry.  That's understandable, but I found that my players needed authorship to have fun in my world.  A natural consequence of your players having agency in your world is that they’ll indelibly leave their mark on it.  This might seem dangerous but let me tell you it actually made my job a lot easier.  Being diligent about listening to and observing my players during play sessions often led to ideas about where to take the story in ways that worked for both them and me.  The biggest example of this is the party’s main rival villain.  I’ll tell the full story in the comments if you want but the short of it is that this NPC was born out of the players mishearing a name, essentially inventing a new character with the misheard name, and expressing interest in interacting with _THAT_ character rather than the character I had written up for them to face.  Listening to them allowed me to craft a villain they’d find compelling and enjoy/hate interacting with simultaneously.  **The character my players “wrote” themselves ended up becoming the most important NPC they interacted with all campaign, with the best session in the whole campaign devoted to the party’s history and interactions with her -- and that character simply would not have existed if I had “overwritten” the players’ authorship over the world.**  

Now, as a caveat, I do want to say that I worked hard to let my players exhibit authorship in a way that didn’t overturn my own.  You could imagine that following up on too many disparate leads based on players’ expressed interests could easily cause the campaign to turn into the kind of “sandbox” we’d like to avoid, but it’s just something to keep in mind.  Your campaign fidelity is important too!
 
Solicit Feedback CONSTANTLY (Corollary: Your Players Don’t Know What They Want)
-------

As mentioned above, I found that always being observant and attentive to what my players did in sessions helped me craft the campaign to fit their needs.  Asking what they wanted outside of play also helped, and I would recommend anybody to do this frequently.  BUT I found that players did not always accurately articulate what they wanted from the campaign when asked directly.  They would use shorthand like “sandbox” to mean “meaningful choices” (as above), or describe a desire for “character development” when what they really wanted was an opportunity for their character’s mechanical skills to shine -– not quite the ""development"" I would have guessed.  I don’t blame them; almost by definition the players aren’t required to think about this kind of thing.  They’re there to roll some dice and solve some puzzles, and it’s been well documented elsewhere that “consumers” often have trouble articulating (even to themselves!) their desires and preferences.  

**It became really important for me to try to piece together, from players’ stated and enacted objectives for play, what their actual objectives really were.**  I think that developing this skill makes a DM not only much more flexible, but much wiser and much more likely to keep players around as, seemingly without the players needing to ask, the campaign tends to start meeting their needs more and more.
 
Off Days Are Normal.  You Won’t Please Everyone.  You Are Still Good At Your Job.  It’s A Hobby. Your Fun Is Important Too. Etc.
------
This seems like a really simple and smarmy “lesson” to end on, but I wanted to make sure I said it explicitly.  All of these “trite” DM “self-help” adages are nonetheless both extremely true and extremely effective.  Everyone feels like they aren’t skilled or experienced enough as a DM sometimes.  Everyone has that session where everything seems off and it looks like the players aren’t having fun.  These thoughts are normal and **I am telling you straight to your face that you can do this, and the more you practice your craft, the better you will be at it.**  Whether or not these thoughts ever go away is, in my experience, completely orthogonal to how well you actually perform as a DM.  I will tell you stories if you like about the times my players expressed dissatisfaction with things I had done as DM or I left a session just wanting to go bang my head against a wall, or the times I felt like I didn’t know how I’d finish the story in a way that made everyone happy.  I will tell you the story of how one of my players spent an hour of the final campaign session playing Terraria and it was somehow fine.  Just remember, the most important part of the game is showing up week after week, putting your best roll forward. **As a DM, you are the most important person at the table, full stop.  Your enjoyment, mental health, creative fulfillment, etc., all factor highly into how sustainable your campaign is.** So, make those things a priority and I promise the rest will improve.
 
There are a bunch of other lessons I learned as well along the way (“D&D isn’t a video game, so don’t fall into the trap of thinking you have to run it like one, even if your players act like it is,” “Don’t get personally attached to characters, either PCs or NPCs,” “Consistency is good not only for your rulings but your narrative power – don’t threaten to kill someone if you won’t kill them,” etc.) but these I think are the most important and the lessons that really took me from a very beginner, novice DM to someone who can literally say I finished a campaign that took players from level 1 to level 14.

-----------

I’m happy to hang out in the comments if anyone wants to chat about anything or hear stories, but mostly I just hope that, if you’re a new DM, you aren’t daunted by the scope of the hobby.  You already have the capacity to learn all the skills you need.  Practice, work hard, and keep your eye on the prize, and I’m confident you’ll be a great DM, and in time you’ll be able to look back on your own lessons learned from your own successfully-completed campaign.  Roll 20s!
",0,"So, I recently finished my first real, long-term D&D campaign.  It ran for five years and ~70 “episodes”) (with some hiatuses), both in-person and over Roll20, was entirely homebrew, took players from level 1 to level 14, and honestly is probably one of the bigger creative accomplishments of my life.  I’ve been reflecting on the experience of DMing a campaign like this and what I’ve learned from it, and wanted to share a few of the more important lessons that I’ll take into my next DMing gig.  Broadly, I found that the three big axes around which I could “optimize” the health of my game were: “player agency,” “campaign fidelity,” and “DM sanity.”  I didn’t explicitly call these categories out below for the most part, but this tri-axis system really came to inform a lot of what I did and how I learned from my experiences, so I thought I’d mention it.

For context, I basically started DMing in earnest at the start of the D&D Next Playtest (Summer 2012) and started this campaign in Summer 2013. So, still pretty green when I started, but hey, it worked out!  I know everyone hates those self-indulgent “LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY CAMPAIGN!!!” stories, so I’ve tried to keep examples from being overly frilly – of course, I’m happy to go into detail on any stories that would be helpful, but wanted to keep the lessons themselves as the focus, not my campaign.  I also don’t really like it when DMs present their own experiences as universally applicable and treat their advice as imperative, so I’ve tried hard to make it clear these lessons were meaningful to ME personally -- I hope they are also meaningful to you but I understand that everyone’s DM style and needs are different.  Anyway, without further ado, here they are:

----------

The single most important lesson I learned is to be flexible. One way to do that is to treat your story more like a TV show than a novel.
----------

I once heard the writers of a network TV show talk about how they went about planning and writing their story.  They started with the central premise and a strong idea of where they wanted to start and end.  They had a well-defined concept of the WHAT of their story (say, “The Story We Want To Tell”)  BUT, they also recognized that the WHAT (“The Story We Want To Tell”) wasn’t synonymous with the HOW (“The Way We Tell Our Story”)  They were ready to write characters out entirely, extend or compact seasons, divert storylines, and so on, because TV is episodic and subject to the whims of the network, audience, actors, etc.  Contrast that to novels, where the author literally has absolute control over both The Story They Want To Tell and The Way They Tell Their Story. Both of those conceptions work to perfectly craft exactly the right narrative, told in exactly the right way.  This great power helps the novelist make the story As Good As Possible, but it’s just not a power available to TV showmakers – or DMs writing their own campaign.
 
For my campaign, the premise was “what if the PCs lived in one of multiple parallel worlds created by the gods at different levels of ‘entropy’?” I built the whole story from that question.  I had a strong idea of how I’d start the story, how the PCs would discover the multiple worlds, and how the story would end.  BUT I didn’t know which of my players would stay or leave.  I didn’t know which NPCs would become important or not.  I didn’t know which hooks players would explore or ignore.  **Treating my story less like a novel and more like a TV show, with a strong idea of What Story I Wanted To Tell but flexibility in How I Told My Story, enabled the campaign to progress organically, meeting both my goals and the players’ needs throughout each arc, all the way to the end.** In fact, I literally broke my campaign into “seasons” and treated sessions as discrete “episodes” leading to “season finales,” etc.  It helped my organization and my mindset tremendously, provided natural break points and places for players to step away or join the campaign, and so on.  I really cannot recommend being flexible in this way enough.
 
Flexibility and Planning Are Two Sides of the Same Creative Coin
------

I’ve seen a lot of DMs online talk about the importance of developing “improv” as a skill.  Personally I suck pretty badly at improv.  And to be honest I don’t think Online DMs really understand what they are saying when they suggest this.  Usually it’s framed as “your games will go better if you’re good at improv and don’t force your session to rigidly conform to your plan!” But, strictly speaking, improv is the practiced performance skill of creating a compelling performance from unscripted/unplanned material, not simply the ability to successfully -- and _flexibly_ -- implement a plan in adverse conditions without clinging dogmatically to a crystallized set of rules.  Improv, defined as above, _can_ be a useful skill for DMs, but _by definition,_ it eschews planning in favor of adaptation, so the ability to implement long-term narrative structures such as foreshadowing is limited to the scope of the improv itself, since nothing outside of the improv’s unplanned material can be brought in. There’s nothing wrong with that! **But I think it’s entirely possible to be flexible and adapt, allowing your players to exhibit agency and be creative -- all while still planning and plotting to your heart’s content.**
 
For me, I found that my ability to contingency-plan and create organized story structures (within the framework described above) made it easier to be flexible in those moments when my players deviated from my “ideal” path.  It didn’t mean I had to abandon my plans or come up with content on the fly.  It just meant I had to use observation and analysis skills to read the situation and decide which set pieces to play or delay, when to pivot, etc. **I had enough contingency plans that instead of “improving,” I was able to be flexible by choosing from several options I had already thought about.**  This reduced my in-game stress considerably, because I honestly do suck at coming up with things on the fly most of the time.  And look, just to be clear, there will always be that one session where you didn’t have time to prep, or you weren’t able to predict your players’ latest weird obsession.  Improving a fun session or two when you need to is a good skill to have, if only so the fun doesn’t stop.  But what I’m saying is that I found smart, rigorous pre-planning a more “flexible” option than resigning myself to making things up as I went – and I don’t think it’s necessary to take that path if you don’t want to.
 

You Can Have It All: “Railroad vs. Sandbox” Is (Sometimes) a False Dichotomy.
-----

 I’m not here to start a big argument about “narrative” or “sandbox” games or whatever.  It’s my personal opinion that when most people talk about wanting their game to be a “sandbox,” what they really mean is that they want player choices to feel like they matter. 

 I think that (most!) D&D players don’t want to play Wizard Minecraft, walking through a world that does nothing until they interact with it and even then only reacting in kind.  I think most players _do_ want some (or even a lot of) narrative direction, some incentive to take actions, and some risks for their choices.  When people say they don’t want to get railroaded, what I think they mean is that they don’t want to feel like they’re NPCs in the DM’s little private novella. They want their choices to matter.  And I think that players (and some DMs) have picked up on this and operationalized the word “sandbox” to capture these feelings, even though IMO it’s a term not well designed for the usage.  And in the meantime, words like “linear,” “narrative-focused,” etc. have become dirty words.
 
**But I think you can have a well-designed, narratively-rich game that builds a linearly progressive story and delivers on things like foreshadowing and character development while still making your players’ choices have real consequences.**  A linear story doesn’t _require_ your players to feel railroaded. One thing that helped me was making sure that the players always knew that there was more going wrong in the world than they could fix with a single choice. This meant that _every_ big choice they made carried _some_ consequence, and gave them a sense of agency from square one.  I also learned that there were subtle ways to present players with multiple options such that one option was more appealing and players were more likely to pick it.  I also learned to use “magician’s choice” well, giving players more of the illusion of choice than an actual choice, which sounds like a cheat but, honestly, it got the job done for players experiencing a sense of agency, which is what they wanted.  **These tools allowed me to tell The Story I Wanted To Tell while still letting players have their agency in The Way The Story Was Told, keeping them from feeling railroaded and making it smoother for everyone.**

"This happened in Cork Ireland.

Walking through town to friends house eating delicious sandwich. Older man and woman approach me clearly alcoholics. Start giving usual sob story she was attacked need money to get home (for drink) I start giving directions to Garda Station (Police). They immediately get aggressive. ""You won't help an old woman in trouble"" ""you can buy food for yourself but won't help her""  ""you should be ashamed"" blah blah blah

At this point I decide to wind them up more. I nake an abashed face and apologise and ask where she lives. They tell me Montenotte - one of the wealthiest areas in Cork. I then start giving them directions to there and they start roaring again. I tell them I know they only want money for drink and to fuck off.

Anyways I go to my buddys apartment on Shandon Street which is quite far from Montenotte and the opposite in pretty much the opposite in every way. High crime rate lots of addicts etc. We hang for about an hour and I go down the street to the off licence (liquor store) and lo and behold who is there but my two friends buying drink. I walk up to them, point and say ""Montenotte is that way""

I will cherise that moment forever.

TL;DR

Two alcoholics ask for money for bus.  I refuse and see them in liquor later and call them out on their bs

"I just lost a match however it was the most fun I've ever had with a sports game in years. I use Spike and he was Bowser. The match was so tactical which you might not really expect from this type of game (I've never really played many Mario titles in the past). 

It was obvious from the start that I struggled with his powerful top spin shots, and he really used this to his advantage. On the other hand, he really struggled with special shots. I'd wait until his meter was full, then use my special shot. He'd then counter this with his special shot, but I kept returning with drop shots which he couldn't handle. 

Eventually he figured out how to deal with this, and we both had 1 racket left and weren't very good at blocking. This led to a stand off in terms of our charged shots - whenever one of used one, the other player would just give up the point in fear of getting knocked out. 

So by the time of the tie break, it was essentially a case of whoever fills their energy meter first, gets the point, which led to some hectic rallies. He eventually beat me 7-5. 

When you get a lag-free match against an opponent of the same ability, this game is amazing in my opinion. I wish there was a little communication system as I'd have loved to congratulate my opponent for that match. 

Sorry if this post is a bit muddled but I'm still feeling the adrenaline from that tie break, and in light of all the (justified) criticism regarding connection, I just wanted to share my experience. I was originally finding it difficult to choose between Tennis World Tour and Mario Tennis Aces, but my mind is made up.

"Edit: ummm ok this wasn't supposed to put me out there like that.... that's a lot of support that I am thankful for. Thanks for everyone sending me private messages asking to give me tips and play with me. You guys rock and I am accepting all the people talking to me. I did not expect this level of support nor the amount of comments coming in. This is a lot to digest so I'm gonna read carefully each persons responses. <3 Thanks guys

You guys are gonna make fun of me....I'm a grown ass man (25) and this game got to me emotionally the other day. I have never been REALLY good at a game. Always average. I don't want to be average anymore. But i'm like really saddened by my attempts to win. I truly truly want to improve and I have everything set for success.

* Builder pro
* 6/6 sens. 
*  gaming headset bought just for this
* Level 73 this season (so trust me...I've put in hours already)


It for real got to me emotionally the other day because I felt like I am just not good at anything. Idk man...fuck..


And because i suck at this game...i already know downvotes are coming since i don't have 500 wins or any trick shot videos with a gliding sniper...

"TLDR; My friend and I were competing in a Microsoft store event where if you won a duo you receive a free 20 dollar gift card each. After 4 hours, we finally won and they didn’t give us anything.

My friend and I went to an awesome Microsoft store event yesterday called Fortnite Friday. The concept was a bunch of people in a Microsoft store who played as many games as they could, and if you won a game you got rewarded with a $25 Microsoft gift card. Lots and lots of people won, but my friend and I kept grinding it out. Finally, at the very end of the competition, we won our duo. I could smell the v-bucks. Then, the employee drops the bombshell that they were out of cards. At first it was disheartening, however I realized that they were the damn Microsoft store! They would surely take my contact information and just give it to us at a later date. But no. They didn’t even let us do that. Screw you Microsoft. I know it is such a little amount of money, but I feel after 4 hours of hard core concentration we deserve what they promised we would get.

"I just got off the phone with my 20 yr old daughter. She is bipolar and was doing better on low dose medication. But her general practitioner referred her out to a “specialist”. She was sent to a “therapy” group. Her therapist has taken her off ALL medications. (Her father committed suicide when she was a child so I’m in full panic mode right now.) 
She just rambled for 48 straight minutes about this therapist and Young Living. I know exactly what it is .. I was dumb enough to buy their start up package for $120. Total rip off. 
Anyway, she sounds absolutely MANIC. And she is clearly brainwashed. I could not get one word in.. so I just let her talk. She went on about a class and a machine that will predict if you are ill or will soon become ill. She was reciting testimonials.. wild claims. Her “treatment” consists of hypnosis and then he gives her oils to smell. She swears it works. But she lost her job last week. 
And if that isn’t bad enough.. this so called therapist is billing her health insurance for this highly manipulative and predatory garbage. 
And now, she plans to have a class so she can get one of her friends off of their anti psychotic meds and if they join, she would not have to pay $100 a month for her products anymore. 

About three weeks ago, when she first mentioned Young Living.. I begged her not to waste her money and I gave her the garbage I bought a year earlier. And I showed her how to get cheaper oils on line. And asked her if she told any of this to her doctor? I at least had her questioning the hype and the price. 
In 3 weeks time, this quack has had her come in once a week for hypnosis... she is so far gone right now and I’m really scared. He has brainwashed her. The grip is horrifically strong. 
I have no idea what to do.

"Like many others on r/greatawakening, when WL first posted what basically amounted to an editorial piece on the legitimacy of Qanon a week ago, I was more than a little mad about it.

How could they do this to us? We trusted them for God's sake! Now they had decided to turn on us, many of us their most die hard supporters for years. They must have been infiltrated by the CIA. These couldn't be the same people that valued truth every bit as much as we do. Yeah, it must be because they're captain is far away in exile, and the government spooks got to them. That HAD to be the reason...didn't it...?

As the week went on, I began to see posts about Back Channel 17 (someone I had never followed much but did check out out of curiousity) claiming to be Julian Assange then going dark, and at almost the exact same time a Twitter handle called EyetheSpy popping up out of no where, claiming to be NSA, and answering questions in an open forum. Again out of curiousity, I checked him out too. After about ten minutes of reading posts from a coder who's page said he was born in 1952, but talked like a 17 year old adolescent, using words like ""fam"" and ""f*wit"" and using ENTIRELY too many Cat Emoticons, I moved on.

Today, I watched a couple of YT videos by Bill Smith (who ironically helped start EtS's quick rise to prominence) which thoroughly and convincingly debunked the EtS phenomenon. No surprise there of course. What did surprise me was how hard some rebelled against the idea that an Anon Twitter account a week old with vague, unverifiable information just HAD to be real, and that Bill Smith had lost it. Irony of all ironies, the guy who brought him to prevalence was now wrong, and the week-old soothsayer was the new expert. It blew me away.

Then, I remembered the WikiLeaks article and the Tweet that accompanied it. 

While we suspect that the ""Qanon"" phenomena is likely 4chan trolls engaging in a Live Action Role Play (LARP) version of the Delphic Oracle it is also clear that many are aware of its manipulative potential and will usurp it if they have not already. https://t.co/Jb3382HOsA

This was somewhat of a Eureka moment for me. Maybe WL wasn't attacking us at all. Maybe they were warning us...

There are several reasons that support my new belief on this.

1) WL doesn't run Opinion Pieces. What was going on with this one?

2)WL generally doesn't make such glaring mistakes on information. They stated that Q was currently posting on 4chan (something he hasn't done in 6 months) and that he started posting in 2015 (it was late October 2017). To Normies, this would simply be glossed over. To Anons though, they would stick out like a sore thumb. Are these signifiers meant for us? Are we being told to be on the lookout for people distributing false information to us?

3) The WL Tweet puts a lot of emphasis on others that ""will usurp it if they have not already"".

4) Both BC17 and EtS, while claiming to support Julian Assange, both directly attacked WL. Now this could just as easily be explained as WL being compromised, and these two, having insider info, working against it EXCEPT Q called BC17 fake.

So here's a simple logic problem:

1) If you believe Q, then you believe that what Q says is true is true, and what he says is false is false.

2) Q says BC17 is fake.

3) EtS says BC17 is 100% reliable.

4) If BC17 is fake, EtS must be fake.

[Conclusion] If you believe Q, both BC17 and EtS are fake.

"Sorry for this shit post but something I just read on here in the comments reminded me of what my friend said to some woman who was pushing hard to get her to come to a Quixtar meeting and join etc

Friend, who bless her soul was a committed hippy, said to the woman:

“I’m not motivated by money in the slightest.I don’t care about money at all.”

End of conversation. There’s literally nowhere Hun could go with that one.

"Hi all. My name is AceAvenger on Twitch but most people call me Ace. I felt like writing this post as more of a reflection for me over the past of year and what I've been through because this year has to be one of the roughest years I have ever been through.

This was the year that I entered graduate school in a new city, not knowing anyone and having to work from the bottom up. The same year where I had my heart broken because my best friend didn't tell me she was dating one of my closest friends. The very year where I had my uncle sent to the hospital needing a kidney transplant but refused to get one because his son was the only eligible donor and my uncle wanted no harm on his son. To top it all, just last week I had one of my closest friends pass away when she was only 20 years old.

Despite all this, the one thing that helped me get through all these shortcomings was being part of the Campfire and Janet's stream. Watching her improvement in all games such as Hearthstone, Fortnite, and many others has given me a lot of happiness over the course of these few months. Watching all those milestones she achieved live such as hitting legend, hitting 100k on Youtube, 300k followers on twitch, 10 million views and of course all those Ws on Fortnite was just amazing to be a part of because I saw it all live. Even when I was going through all this, many people like Janet and people from the Campfire have provided me encouragement to keep going and for that I will be always grateful.

For this Janet I just wanted to say thank you for being your wholesome self and always providing me smiles through these tough times and all those who in the campfire who believed in me when I couldn't even believe in myself. For this I will be eternally grateful. Thank you Janet for everything. Seeing your growth every day has really made me excited for your future and what comes next so I'll continue watching. I'll see you at the top because that's where I know you'll be. Fed7.",41,1527990129.0,8o27oa,False,"Hi all. My name is AceAvenger on Twitch but most people call me Ace.

"In a microcosm, the Obama-IC-DOJ-State Department can also be taken down for the Trump campaign sabotage under the RICO statute (and all involved), but on a macro level (and many of the same offenders are involved), the way the Obama-led government operated would also be a Protection Racket RICO case.

A Protection Racket, a most common form of Racketeering is when a company or organization provides and offers protection at a price, while they simultaneously are the cause of that protection offered. From there, corruption, extortion, and all forms of illegal activity go on in the Racket. The protection comes in many forms, but the American people wouldn't need that level of protection if the administration didn't cause it to be needed. In doing so, the Racket becomes larger and more powerful, while the victim (the American people) suffers, but continue to keep paying more. 

From Wikipedia: ""The most common example of a racket is the ""protection racket,"" which promises to protect the target business or person from dangerous individuals in the neighborhood and then either collects the money or causes damages to the business until the owner pays. The racket exists as both the problem and its solution, and it is used as a method of extortion.""

 

The main systems for this were the Surveillance State and FISA abuses, Letting or allowing in illegal immigrants not properly vetted from MS-13 to illegal immigrants And Muslim terrorists (*""Bringing in, aiding or assisting aliens in illegally entering the country (if the action was for financial gain""), sending jobs overseas, selling out to foreign countries and interests at the citizens' expense, and a whole lot more.

The Hillary-Obama-Brennan-FBI cabal against Trump is a vintage Racketeering case, a RICO case. Under the guise of ""protecting the US AND Trump (yeah right) against the Russians"", they leveraged that to extort and try to blackmail Trump, his family, and members of the campaign. In prototypical Racket fashion, this protection would not be needed if it weren't for the cabal culprits also ""causing"" it. 

How do you know they caused it? I) Obama and his administration did NOTHING to try to stop, or prevent the so-called Russians from trying to tamper in the election; he let it go, and he and his top level officials even have admitted so. It's plain and clear. II) He/they CAUSED it. Not only did the Clinton campaign and Obama pay for and hire British-Russia connected informants to try to entrap low level Trump officials like Papadoupolis, they also allowed the Russian lawyer Veselnetskya into the country, even though she was sanctioned and shouldn't have been allowed in. III) Uranium One: this could be one of the big and lesser discussed reasons why the Racket was formed, in addition to undermining a perceived political enemy, if indeed nefarious activity took place. Ergo, the Racket creates a perceived enemy to themselves as Russia, that they created, when in fact the victims (Trump campaign) would not have perceived that problem in the first place. IV) Extension: Protecting the ""American People"" also from the Russians with the phony investigation isn't really necessary if the Obama-Hillary-Clinton cabal didn't allow it to happen (the Russia meddling) and cause it to happen themselves, admittedly, in the first place.

This is a classic, vintage case of Protection Racket and can be tried and prosecuted under the RICO statute without question. It also implicates the journalists and mainstream media who coordinated it (NYT, CNN, NBC, Newsweek) and all other co-conspirators because they were likely extorted, bribed, and coerced into going along with it and covering it up. 

""Originally and often still specifically, a racket was a criminal act in which the perpetrator or perpetrators offer a service that is fraudulently offered to solve a nonexistent problem, a service that will not be put into effect, or a service that would not exist without the racket. Conducting a racket is racketeering.[1] Particularly, the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it, but that fact may be concealed, with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party.""

"Just one more thing on ObamaCare Repeal.  
Since only 11 million people have ObamaCare, how will 24 million people die if it is repealed? Will an additional 13 million people be randomly shot?

Just one more thing on Donald Trump.  
If Donald Trump deleted all of his emails, wiped his server with Bleach bit and destroyed all of his phones with a hammer, would the Mainstream Media suddenly lose all interest in the story and declare him innocent.

Just one more thing on equal pay.  
If women do the same job for less money, why do companies hire men to do the same job for more money?

Just one more thing on Sanctuary Cities.  
If you rob a bank in a Sanctuary City, is it illegal or is it just an Undocumented Withdrawal?

Just one more thing on ISIS.  
Each ISIS attack now is a reaction to Trump policies, but all ISIS attacks during Obama’s term were due to Climate Change and a plea for jobs.

Just one more thing on the London ‘Lone Wolf’ terror attack.  
After the London ‘Lone Wolf’ terrorist attack government officials have arrested at least eight other ‘Lone Wolves’ who had conspired with the original ‘Lone Wolf’ in planning the ‘Lone Wolf’ attack. Even though all involved are Muslims, you can be assured, the ‘Lone Wolf’ attack has nothing at all to do with Islam, just like the other 1000 plus ‘Lone Wolf’ attacks by Muslims, are completely unassociated with Islam.

Just one more thing on Entitlements.  
We should stop calling them all ‘Entitlements’. Welfare, Food Stamps, WIC, ad nauseum are not entitlements. They are taxpayer\-funded handouts, and shouldn’t be called entitlements at all.  
Social Security and Veterans Benefits are Entitlements because the people receiving them are entitled to them. They were earned and paid for by the recipients.

Just one more thing on the Muslim Refugees.  
If Muslims want to run away from a Muslim country, does that mean they’re Islamophobic?

Just one more thing on The Women’s March.  
If Liberals don’t believe in biological gender then why did they march for women’s rights?

Just one more thing on the Russians hacking the election.  
How did the Russians get Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC to steal the Primary from Bernie Sanders? How did Russia get Donna Brazil to leak debate questions to Hillary Clinton in advance of the debates?

Just one more thing on Democrats and the Electoral College.  
Why is it that Democrats think Super delegates are fine, but they have a problem with the Electoral College?

Just one more thing on the FBI and elections.  
If you don’t want the FBI involved in elections, don’t nominate someone who’s being investigated by the FBI.

Just one more thing on Hillary’s speeches.  
If Hillary’s speeches cost $250,000 an hour, how come no one shows up to her free ones?

Just one more thing on Russia manipulating our election.  
The DNC is mad at Russia because they ‘think’ they are trying to manipulate our election by exposing that the DNC is manipulating  
our election?

Just one more thing on foreign involvement in our elections.

We should stop calling them all ‘Entitlements’. Welfare, Food Stamps, WIC, ad nauseum are not entitlements. They are taxpayer\-funded handouts, and shouldn’t be called entitlements at all.  
Social Security and Veterans Benefits are Entitlements because the people receiving them are entitled to them. They were earned and paid for by the recipients.

Just one more thing on the Muslim Refugees.  
If Muslims want to run away from a Muslim country, does that mean they’re Islamophobic?

Just one more thing on The Women’s March.  
If Liberals don’t believe in biological gender then why did they march for women’s rights?

Just one more thing on the Russians hacking the election.  
How did the Russians get Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC to steal the Primary from Bernie Sanders? How did Russia get Donna Brazil to leak debate questions to Hillary Clinton in advance of the debates?

Just one more thing on Democrats and the Electoral College.  
Why is it that Democrats think Super delegates are fine, but they have a problem with the Electoral College?

Just one more thing on the FBI and elections.  
If you don’t want the FBI involved in elections, don’t nominate someone who’s being investigated by the FBI.

Just one more thing on Hillary’s speeches.  
If Hillary’s speeches cost $250,000 an hour, how come no one shows up to her free ones?

Just one more thing on Russia manipulating our election.  
The DNC is mad at Russia because they ‘think’ they are trying to manipulate our election by exposing that the DNC is manipulating  
our election?

Just one more thing on foreign involvement in our elections.  
If Democrats don’t want foreigners involved in our elections, why do they think it’s all right for illegals to vote?",0,"Just one more thing on ObamaCare Repeal.  
Since only 11 million people have ObamaCare, how will 24 million people die if it is repealed? Will an additional 13 million people be randomly shot?

Just one more thing on Donald Trump.  
If Donald Trump deleted all of his emails, wiped his server with Bleach bit and destroyed all of his phones with a hammer, would the Mainstream Media suddenly lose all interest in the story and declare him innocent.

Just one more thing on equal pay.  
If women do the same job for less money, why do companies hire men to do the same job for more money?

Just one more thing on Sanctuary Cities.  
If you rob a bank in a Sanctuary City, is it illegal or is it just an Undocumented Withdrawal?

Just one more thing on ISIS.  
Each ISIS attack now is a reaction to Trump policies, but all ISIS attacks during Obama’s term were due to Climate Change and a plea for jobs.

Just one more thing on the London ‘Lone Wolf’ terror attack.  
After the London ‘Lone Wolf’ terrorist attack government officials have arrested at least eight other ‘Lone Wolves’ who had conspired with the original ‘Lone Wolf’ in planning the ‘Lone Wolf’ attack. Even though all involved are Muslims, you can be assured, the ‘Lone Wolf’ attack has nothing at all to do with Islam, just like the other 1000 plus ‘Lone Wolf’ attacks by Muslims, are completely unassociated with Islam.

"We all know Wikileaks was given the DNC emails from Seth Rich (perhaps via Megaupload, perhaps not)

We all know Wikileaks has information on the cabal, a cabal Q is fighting.

We all know those still asleep have turned sour on Julian Assange because he exposed (just the tip) of the crimes carried out by blood members and paid members of the satanic Clinton crime family.

If you were Q, how would incorporate a release of an HRC video, or 33,000 emails the cabal tried (and failed) to destroy, which are evidence of the crimes?

Suppose it was released today.  Result?

It would awaken fewer people.  Think logically.  How would a release of information be received by an organization the D's revile?  

Now think of a plan to maximize the impact of the release.  Awaken the most people.

How does the mind asleep think?  Dreamworlds are created.

If it comes from anyone but those in dreamland, it is necessarily false.

Karl Marx the fucking dolt!  Look at the world your elitist bourgeoisie class mind has foisted upon the world!

What would you do with a cult like mentality like that?

You invert.

You turn that predictability into a temporal asset.  

Ok, so the solution then is to make the D's defend Wikileaks somehow.

How do you do that?

You ask Wikileaks to distance itself from you, and not only that, but ask them to start publicly doubting your credibility.

Is this not exactly out of the Q playbook?

Trump bashing Sessions publicly, while Q explains it's acting and writes ""Trust Sessions"", remember?

The D's have to *think* Wikileaks is Trump's nemesis.

When Q said to expect the attacks getting worse on both sides, I think it meant more than many of us believed.

People in a ideological cult (We all know those asleep are controlled by an actual (Satanic) cult at this point, Op Mockingbird has made millions of us fall asleep, but Q has awakened many more worldwide) will only listen to those in dreamland.

Their dreamland is predictable because we discovered their code.

"Apologies if someone has already postulated this, but here goes:

Thanos is not capable of using the infinity gems unless he clenches his infinity-gauntlet-wearing fist.

Evidence:
- Doctor Strange told his cloak: ""Don't let him clench his fist"" in reference to his gauntlet hand. The cloak keeps Thanos from clenching the fist, and as a result for that period Thanos can't use the gems.

- Tony Stark shot that device at the gauntlet that kept Thanos from closing his fist. Similarly, Thanos couldn't use the gems during that period.

- Captain America is not blocking a punch from Thanos's infinity-gauntlet hand. He's *holding* Thanos's hand open, keeping Thanos from clenching his fist to use the stones (this is why Thanos has to then punch Captain America using his right (non-infinity gauntlet) hand).

The counterargument is that Thanos didn't clench his fist when he snapped his fingers, but when Thanos snapped his fingers, his fist was practically clenched *and* he had all six stones at that point.

"Hey r/FortniteBR!

I'm beyond pleased to formally announce the new additions to our moderation team. As this subreddit has continued to grow, we've seen an incredible amount of traffic and posts from this community, and we have been on the lookout for outstanding members of the Fortnite family to assist us in managing the load. Thank you to all 832 of you that submitted applications for the latest round, we were incredibly impressed with the quality of the applicant pool! You can see our recent subreddit traffic stats [in our moderator recruitment post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8jwu1d/new_moderator_recruitment/).

This time around, we have decided to nearly double our previous moderation team bringing on 11 new mods, with these new moderators having a heavy focus on modqueue/modmail. Please welcome fellow STW mods /u/Necrologyx, /u/WindAeris, /u/sexualrhinoceros and new mods /u/PlexversalHD, /u/XplosiveCows, /u/HereticxAnthem, /u/Snaacky, /u/BeardyDuck, /u/bosilk, /u/jesuspunk, and /u/Dubstep4Moms! (Dubstep4Moms had to make a new account because his previous account name was... quite NSFW)

Previously, because of the thousands of posts a day, we would often get up to a day behind on unmoderated (posts that we haven't manually gone over) and hundreds of modmails behind, leading to a lot of spam, low effort content, and long wait times for inquiries about the subreddit. However, we hope that with the help of the new mods, response times to reports and modmails should be reduced significantly!
